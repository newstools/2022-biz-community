While the car was initially launched in 2002 as a utilitarian all-terrain vehicle, the fourth-generation Sorento has been transformed into something altogether more desirable, and representing the perfect balance between premium quality features and value for money.” Matured confidenceKia’s designers maintained the robust, tough-looking aesthetic of earlier generations of Sorento while applying a greater degree of refinement and elegance, and even a sense of sportiness. With more contemporary geometric details, the result is a more confident, more mature and more desirable design.

This sharper, more assertive appearance is complemented by a wide, rectangular lower air intake. A sharp bumper lip is also capped with a skid plate, enhancing its robust appearance. An inviting interiorAttractive, upscaled cabin with premium materials and progressive tech.Image suppliedImage suppliedOne of the highest-quality interior spaces found in any Kia to date, the intuitive, tech-oriented cabin of the new Sorento is fitted with premium-quality materials and cutting-edge infotainment. At the same time, it retains the spaciousness and versatility. Go digitalThe attractive, upscale cabin introduces a sophisticated next-generation design, based around twin digital displays in the dashboard. The 12.3-inch digital driver instrument cluster is twinned with 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment and navigation system at the centre of the dashboard. These display information clearly within the driver’s line of sight and create an innovative wide-screen user experience. The car’s many functions can also be controlled with new haptic buttons on either side of the screen, which also features further down the dashboard for the climate control system. A wireless smartphone charger also sits at the base of the centre console, while a powerful Bose surround-sound system is also available to provide a more immersive in-car audio experience.Material quality is enhanced, with a cabin that blends metallic trim, leather upholstery, and embossed satin-effect surfaces. Applied throughout the interior and across the dashboard, the cabin boasts a more sophisticated appearance and ambience as a result. The Sorento is offered to buyers with standard black single-tone leather trim.Powerful new turbodiesel engineA new four-cylinder, 2.2l‘Smartstream’ diesel engine is available in the Sorento. The powerplant produces 148kW at 3,800 r/min and 440Nm of torque between 1,750 and 2,750 r/min. With a new aluminium block, the new engine is 38.2 kg lighter compared to that found in the third-generation. Furthermore, it is paired with Kia’s new eight-speed wet double-clutch transmission (8DCT). Designed to offer the smooth shifting characteristics of a conventional automatic, the 8DCT enhances fuel efficiency over a conventional eight-speed automatic, depending on application.Some feature highlights on the EX+: 8” touchscreen infotainment with Apple CarPlay and Android AutoAutomatic dual-zone climate controlAuto lights and wipersAuto-folding, heated side mirrorsDrive Mode Select and Terrain Mode SelectElectrically adjustable front seats with lumbar supportLeather trimLED headlampsSmart Entry with push-button startPDC front and rear with rear-view camera18” aluminium alloy wheelsBose surround sound with 12 speakersDual LED headlamps LED rear combination lampsHead-up displayPanoramic sunroofRRP including VATSorento 2.2 CRDi 7-Seater EX+ 2WD 8DCT - R809,995Sorento 2.2 CRDi 7-Seater EX+ AWD 8DCT - R849,995Sorento 2.2 CRDi 7-Seater SX AWD 8DCT - R914,995Sorento 2.2 CRDi 7-Seater SXL AWD 8DCT - R988,995
