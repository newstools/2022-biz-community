Fast forward to 2022 and Machine_ is back with another PepsiCo SSA pitch win, following the corporation’s large-scale pitching drive, across all disciplines, which came as a result of its acquisition of Pioneer Foods. Retaining their Simba and Lay’s digital portfolios, Machine_ has now added White Star, Sasko, Liqui-Fruit, Weet-Bix and Spekko to their growing arsenal of top brands.  “Another invitation to pitch on the digital portfolio at PepsiCo was a great confidence boost for us,” says Lindsey Rayner, Managing Director of Machine_ in Johannesburg, “and I believe the win is a true testament to our agency’s ability to understand the consumer’s digital mindset, plan strategically, problem solve and maximise our clients’ investments.” The expansion of their PepsiCo brand complement follows Machine_’s launch of South Africa’s first ever branded hashtag challenge on TikTok, which went live last year, as well as great successes with the Simba Flavour Battle and Lay’s Movie Night campaigns. Machine_ appointed lead digital creative agency for PepsiCo SSA snack portfolioIssued by Machine_ 10 Feb 2021“Our goal is to always create work that is relevant to consumers and the environment they are playing in,” explains Rayner, “and as social media is often about entertainment value, we’ve seen the shift in focus from brands creating content that is sharable, to content that inspires creative expression and engagement. We saw this in the performance of our Doritos challenge last year.” The Doritos campaign, launched with well-known dancer and singer Kamo Mphela, exceeded expectations when it came down to results. It saw two million unique users in the first six days, 38.1 million video views during the campaign period and gave rise to a staggering 45,000 pieces of user-generated content made and shared by content creators on TikTok.
