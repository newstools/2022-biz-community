The ceremony will be presented on 22 April in Cape Town. The independent Kanna panel had Rafiek Mammon as its convenor and included Gary Naidoo, Laetitia Pople, Diane de Beer, Alby Michaels, Marguerite Robinson and Robyn van de Rhede. Mammon said, “We, as an independent panel, literally sat in a room every morning before eight to discuss the five or six productions we saw the previous day. And every morning – up to the last day of the festival – these conversations were drenched in passion, seriousness, and love.” Inaugural Fashion Industry Awards South Africa winners revealed1 Apr 2022“It is not just that we could have a festival in person, and to have been able to see and hear artists live. It was also about the quality of the work. The quality of the productions at the KKNK was so good the panel literally struggled in putting together a shortlist of nominees under the variety of valued offerings,” Mammon continued.  All productions on this year’s festival programme were eligible for the 14 awards, but an additional Herrie Award, as well as two other special awards, will be announced at the ceremony later this month.
