Supplied. The inaugural DStv Content Creator Awards will recognise the people, influencers, brands and agencies that make us feel goodOver the last couple of years, we’ve all consumed more content than ever before, and the quality of content that’s out there is next level. There are more social media platforms, more content creators, and more fans to enjoy it.  But there’s nothing out there that celebrates them. Until now…The awards will shine a light on the people, influencers, brands and agencies that make us feel good. Industry supportFounded by marketing agency, One-eyed Jack, and supported by DStv, the awards have already garnered huge industry support. Thabisa Mkhwanazi, executive head of Marketing, MultiChoice South Africa, comments: “We saw this partnership as the perfect platform to align with, as it supports our ethos of pioneering new paths for content creation and uplifting our exceptional local talent. “As the biggest funder of local content and sport in Africa, we’re looking forward to fantastic ways to leverage this collaboration with maximum impact for the creators, our channels and the South African public."For many people, creating content has become a career and legitimate source of income, so the awards will bring them the applause of the adoring masses, and bestow upon them a (not-too-heavy-but-still-significant) specially designed trophy.“As a platform that continuously looks to inspire authentic creativity and amazing content, this for us forms part of the many ways in which we recognise and celebrate our local talent,” says Saul Moross, TikTok’s Creator Operations Lead for sub-Saharan Africa.“Our community can look forward to fun hashtag challenges and informative creator workshop Live streams,” adds Moross.
