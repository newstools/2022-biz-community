Customer lifetime value (CLV) is a business metric that measures how much a business can plan to earn from the average customer over the course of a relationship. There are quite a few factors that can make CLV a complex thing to calculate - but with the right tools, you can find your CLV. When you understand CLV, you will be able to make better informed decisions. Kevin Britz and Craig Page-Lee, hosts of Lunchtime Marketing every Thursday at 12pm on www.ebizradio.com, discuss and unpack this layer by layer.
