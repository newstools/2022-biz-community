Gala’s ingenious blend of ethereal dreamy synths and ‘80s inspired beats, coupled with Billington’s heartfelt raspy vocals, takes you on a nostalgic drive down memory lane and could very easily be mistaken for a soundtrack from the mid-eighties - only a little more polished.Billington explains, “When I listened to the demo for the first time, I broke down and cried. I was really struggling with the passing of someone very close to me and this project just felt like the perfect celebration of life and remembrance.”Homesick timeously coincides with Nic’s recent relocation to the United Kingdom, and although the singer has noted that he is missing home, the song speaks more about the precious moments lost in time and not a particular place.The single is accompanied by a super slick visual that showcases Billington and friends on a carefree night out in England's capital city, London.“I really wanted to capture spontaneity, excitement and fun for this visual, and we definitely understood the brief. At one point we even put the cameras away and missioned across the city on Boris bikes. I wish the process behind all music videos was this easy-going and fun”, Billington said.Billington, whose musical influences include The Weeknd, has also just kicked off a promotional tour in the UK to promote the new single.I caught up with him last week….bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important} What is your job description?
