"Business travel is about solidifying relationships, getting things done and growing one’s business. SMEs are travelling because they can’t afford not to. A business’s competitive edge is often reliant on building relationships with suppliers or partners through more face-to-face meetings, negotiating deals, and exploring opportunities – all of which is very difficult over Zoom."According to Desai, smaller companies are also a lot nimbler and more flexible when it comes to international travel, with many ready to travel as soon as destinations opened. But travel has changed post-Covid-19. "While SMEs are getting back on the road, increasingly, they’re looking to do it with the support of a travel advisor. We’re seeing a shift from unmanaged, do-it-yourself travel bookings to more managed travel – including putting formal travel policies in place and taking a more considered approach to risk management and duty of care obligations."Each month, Corporate Traveller will release a new chapter, covering topics such as: • The limitations of unmanaged, DIY-travel,• How to craft the perfect travel policy, • Where to find savings without compromising traveller safety, and• Sustainability and your travel programme. The toolkit includes: • A smarter savings guide; • 5 quick wins to save money; • How to offload your travel admin; • Tips on what to look for in a TMC; and more.  "We have taken a close look at exactly what SMEs need right now and developed a simple toolkit, packed with plenty of information and tips, to support their return to business travel," concludes Desai.The SME toolkit is hosted on Corporate Traveller’s website.
