I'm leaving my listeners in the very capable hands of someone I think they'll really enjoy. Personally, I can't wait to listen to his show”. “I am a big CapeTalk fan and listener. This opportunity to learn, add the medium of talk to my resume and challenge myself by trying something new has me nervous and very excited! I hope the listeners will be kind and listen with a forgiving ear! I may even be able to convince CapeTalk to play one or two of my favourite jazz songs at the start of the week,” said Clarence Ford, CapeTalk stand-in presenter.Listeners can look forward to a mix of news, information and lifestyle elements the show has become famous for, along with some unique perspectives from Clarrie.
