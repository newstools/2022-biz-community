We initially went through the baking craze but noticed an appetite among customers experimenting with different fresh foods,” says Andrew Mills, group executive of marketing at Pick n Pay. The general pattern is to try new recipes weekly (30%) or whenever inspiration hits (30%), followed by once or twice a month (24%). Nearly one in ten of the survey’s respondents said they experiment with new recipes daily. The survey revealed that the most common motivation for experimenting with new recipes is the desire to improve one’s cooking skills (32%). The next most popular reason is wanting to try new dishes or food (26%). Another popular reason is the desire to make delicious food for friends and family (18%). The remaining 11% just want to escape the humdrum of repeatedly cooking the same thing.
