Sappi has been deeply saddened by the loss of life and devastating impact of these floods on the people of KwaZulu-Natal. Our condolences go out to the families of those in various communities who have lost loved ones.In addition to this devastating loss of life, many more people have been displaced, losing their homes and valued possessions. These conditions have been further exacerbated by power outages and no water supply in some areas.To provide some meaningful and immediate support to the affected people, Sappi Southern Africa has made a substantial donation of R1m to The Gift of the Givers Association.“We chose the Gift of the Givers, because we have been continually impressed by this organisation that works so tirelessly in providing relief to communities; not only when disaster strikes but consistently on an ongoing basis,” said Alex Thiel, CEO of Sappi Southern Africa.Sappi trusts that this funding will provide support for immediate emergency life-saving efforts, as well as providing longer-term support in the affected areas by providing essential items such as food and clothing. Sappi has also put systems in place for personnel to contribute towards two other local organisations – The Robin Hood Foundation and The Angel Network – by dropping off items like non-perishable, food, clothing, blankets at collection points at their business units.Sappi will also partner with the authorities in the rebuilding of homes and infrastructure in the province.Your browser does not support the audio tag.
