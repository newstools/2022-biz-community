From its inception, BASA’s Supporting Grants programme has committed itself to augmenting and amplifying powerful partnerships between business and arts partners to effect meaningful social change. "BASA grant-making has a significantly different purpose compared to other more conventional arts funding models,” comments BASA CEO, Ashraf Johaardien. “The purpose of our Supporting Grants has never been to fund projects per se, but rather to support partnerships with a clear focus on amplifying and extending these,” they explain. The workshop extends the Grants’ original intention by ensuring applicants have a full understanding of the process, with defined deliverables communicated in explicit steps. Interested parties are encouraged to register for the live webinar, and can do so here. Applicants are then invited to submit a formal letter of interest as their next step. Eligible applicants who meet the necessary criteria will be invited to complete an online application. The next deadline for letters of interest is 29 April 2022 for projects commencing from 1 August 2022. Visit https://basa.co.za/, click on the ‘Grants’ tab, and navigate to ‘Supporting Grants’ for detailed criteria and further guidelines. Note that BASA's decision with regard to the outcomes of Supporting Grants applications is final and no further correspondence will be entered into.
