The name Urban Zulu embodies the ideal of the Urban Heaven. Inspired by the spiritual, connected to the beauty and texture of the physical, Urban Zulu reflects the balance between the higher ideals of love and unity and practical functionality. The “Urban” element of the brand speaks to the fast-paced lifestyle demands of modern living.After dropping out of university due to a lack of funds, Papy Kaluw, Urban Zulu founder, taught himself how to hold a hand needle, and nearly two decades later is taking his brand to the world. The Pan African clothing brand has partnered with Nubian Hueman, a modern boutique store featuring African apparel based in Washington DC, USA.“The roots of Urban Zulu have always been about African people uniting,” says Kaluw. He adds that “this partnership allows Africans and those with African roots, no matter where they are to experience Urban Zulu and be united through clothes.”The partnership will allow Urban Zulu to have a physical presence and a store in Washington DC.
