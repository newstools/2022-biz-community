Celebrating 127 years of cinema in South Africa3 days agoIn spite of legal limits, unchecked industrial fishing in the 1970s, followed by poaching by gangs from the 2000s, has significantly affected both lobster populations and fisher livelihoods, leaving the fishery on the brink of disaster today. David talks of Abalobi’s entrance into the industry and how the traceability technology, co-developed with the fishers, has started to transform his career and ultimately, the entire community’s livelihoods.“The award is amazing recognition for us as an organisation, but even more so for the small-scale fisherwomen and men with whom we work,” says Raemaekers, MD of Abalobi. “They are grateful that their story is being heard and being recognised. There is a desperate need for effective, alternative interventions contrary to disengaging from the rock lobster fishery, and the communities that depend on it. To achieve any form of sustainability, we need to rethink how we get there and have a greater focus on the fishers who rely on marine resources. We have to engage, and reimagine fair, transparent market opportunities,” Raemaekers continues.3 awards for short film Leemtes en Leegheid14 Apr 2022Executive director for the festival, Ana Blanco, says that the 11 films awarded prizes this year are deserving of recognition because of the way they stand out in a field of exceptional quality and diversity. “All of our films and filmmakers are standouts and advance our mission of saving our oceans through the beauty and education of the visual medium.”Coding for Crayfish is available to watch online here.
