Chefs from the region’s top restaurants will come together in designing and hosting a trio of dinners that shine the spotlight on local excellence. Wines from the region are part of the experience having been paired with the dishes and will be presented by winemakers themselves.For the autumn edition, the dinners will take place at a different venue each time, featuring different teams, dishes and wines. Teams were given the theme of farm to table for their designs, which provides the opportunity to celebrate fresh, seasonal produce.
