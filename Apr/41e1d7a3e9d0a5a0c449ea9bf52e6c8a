Duane Petersen, director of JG AfrikaSome of Petersen’s career highlights includes his recent participation in overseeing the construction of the Prince George Drive Solid Waste Drop-off Facility in Parkwood, as well as the Gordon’s Bay and Wynberg Chipping Facilities. He led the development of a management plan for the Stellenbosch Rivers on behalf of the Stellenbosch Local Municipality. Completed in 2011, the document is still being referenced by the client.Moreover, Petersen assisted with the planning of major upgrades to the stormwater system in Mitchells Plain. The project entailed extensive infield work and intense modelling to provide a 10-year horizon that also considered climate change.In his new capacity, Petersen will help steer JG Afrika onto its next growth path. “While I remain cautiously optimistic about the state of the South African market, considering government’s focus on large infrastructure development to kick-start the post-Covid-19 economy, we are also exploring other growth areas. Many of these opportunities are emerging in other countries and could potentially harness our 23 different disciplines and fields of expertise,” Petersen says.He will also be responsible for the Western and Eastern Cape regions.
