It provides a “transformational experience” at Harvard University during the fellowship year. Fellowships are for up to one year of study in one of Harvard’s Professional and Graduate Schools, with tuition provided by the participating school. General administrative funds for programme management, stipends, and airfare for the fellows are provided by the Office of the President and administered by the Centre for African Studies. Since the Harvard South Africa Fellowship Programme was established over 40 years ago, more than 220 men and women are counted among the alumni of the programme. They represent leadership positions in all aspects of South African society. Their careers span across education, law, public health, the arts and humanities, business and the private sector, and a host of other professions and disciplines, including many professors and senior administrators at universities in South Africa.The Harvard University Centre for African Studies, with its Africa office based in Johannesburg, is a globally recognised, interdisciplinary body committed to broadening knowledge about Africa and engagement with African perspectives through scholarship, collaboration, and dialogue.
