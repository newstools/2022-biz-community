"This investment focuses on enabling fast, affordable internet access for more Africans, building helpful products, supporting entrepreneurs and small businesses and helping nonprofits to improve lives across Africa. In 2018 Google also opened an AI research centre in Accra, Ghana to help drive useful innovations," Google said in a statement.VP for products, Suzanne Frey said:“Google’s mission in Africa is to make the Internet helpful to Africans and partner with African governments, policymakers, educators, entrepreneurs and businesses to shape the next wave of innovation in Africa.  “I am excited to welcome all Africans passionate about improving the digital experience of African users by building better products to apply for the open roles at our first product development centre in Africa.”Nitin Gajria, managing director for Google in Africa added:“There are 300m internet users in Africa who are young, mobile-first and have similar patterns to mobile youth globally. By 2030, Africa will have 800m internet users and a third of the world’s under-35 population. “The potential for Africa to become a leading digital economy is right on the horizon and Google is committed to accelerating Africa’s digital transformation through human capital and enabling “African-led solutions to African and global problems” through better products.”All the roles announced today about building for Africa and the world can be viewed here.
