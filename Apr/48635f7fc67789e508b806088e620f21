Additionally, to the ‘Live in uMmngeni’ event programme at the Capture Site, the festival presents an extensive programme of online events broadcast on YouTube and Facebook - and the audience can join on Zoom. “We are delighted that with the end of the national lockdowns, we can present a hybrid festival this year with both online and live events; the latter made possible through a partnership with the uMngeni Municipality and uMngeni Tourism”, said Ismail Mahomed, director for the Centre for Creative Arts. “The six-day ‘Live in uMngeni’ programme will feature theatre, dance, music, exhibitions, film and a specially curated animation series of some of Nelson Mandela’s favourite folktales aimed explicitly at children.”The six-day programme will take place at the Nelson Mandela Capture Site to commemorate the 60th anniversary of when Nelson Mandela has captured on the roadside a short distance from Howick. Following his 27-years of detention and transitioning South Africa into a constitutional democracy Nelson Mandela was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize by the international community. “The festival located at the Capture Site intends to draw inspiration from Mandela’s legacy and rekindle tourism to the site after the devastating impact of the national lockdown on the cultural economy. Our partnership with the uMngeni Municipality and uMngeni Tourism aims to strengthen a cultural economy that enables local art organisations to thrive”, said Mahomed.The festival will open on 3 May with an online opening at 3pm filmed from the capture site and feature this year’s keynote speaker Chester Missing who will provide entertaining but biting commentary about South Africa’s democracy.What to expectLive in Umngeni will open with the Umongo Msindo (Sounds in Context) exhibition, an immersive installation that brings musicians into conversations with their traditional African instruments through videos and textiles that function as interactive wall pieces and a QR portal that expands on their work.
