East Coast Radio joined hands with Gift of the Givers to offer aid and relief to the communities and people affected. They called in their stakeholders and their loyal listeners to open their hearts and wallets and help with the #ECRFloodRelief campaign.“As a local business, ECR was concerned by the recent KZN floods because we care about the people of KZN. We hope our efforts will touch lives of most needing families meaningfully,” said Boni Mchunu, MD of East Coast Radio.On Friday 22 April ECR broadcasted outside their offices and invited all South Africans to donate items such as blankets, clothes, sanitary products, and canned foods. On its pledge line, East Coast Radio managed to raise over R6.7m worth of products and cash donations. Donations from different sectors such as car dealerships, FMCG companies, clothing companies, financial institutions, schools, homeware stores, and many others were received. The station’s loyal listeners came down with their families to donate, which displayed what we can do as a people when we come together. “On behalf of ECR, I would like to sincerely thank you, our listeners, stakeholders, partners, and sponsors for heeding the call. Thank you for your generosity. Your kindness to human comes with courage. With your donations, we will be able to touch many lives. We appreciate your unwavering support,” Mchunu added. The true definition of Ubuntu was displayed with this initiative. All donations will go to those affected by the #KZNfloods. Our hope is to help rebuild homes and livelihoods of the people of our province.
