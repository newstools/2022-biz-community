We will continue to be a predominantly private-label group, but our ‘Value Champion’ purpose can also be lived out through the aspirational fashion market, and we are very excited about these prospects.”Blair continued, “What attracts us to the Studio 88 Group is their deep understanding of trend-conscious South African consumers and their ability to address their needs via their various trading formats. We also share a similar DNA, both being founder-led businesses intent on offering customers superior value and have high-performance cultures.”Pepkor expands to South America with acquisition of Brazil's Avenida3 Feb 2022LeadershipThe founder of the Studio 88 Group, Laurence Wernars, will continue running the business, maintaining his trusted management team.
