From its inception, Basa’s Supporting Grants programme has committed to augmenting and amplifying powerful partnerships between business and arts partners to effect meaningful social change. "Basa grantmaking has a significantly different purpose compared to other more conventional arts funding models,” commented Basa CEO, Ashraf Johaardien. “The purpose of our Supporting Grants has never been to fund projects per se, but rather to support partnerships with a clear focus on amplifying and extending these,” he explains. The next deadline for letters of interest is 29 April 2022 for projects taking place from August 2022. Applicants should take note that a range of criteria is considered, including but not limited to the scale and impact of the project, artistic merit, feasibility, contribution to social cohesion, and the reach of the proposed project, all in relation to the funding available for disbursement. Preference is given to projects that offer tangible benefits to their business sponsor(s), and since Basa is a membership organisation, preference is given to projects where both the arts organisation and business sponsor(s) are Basa members.Basa Membership registration is quick and simple.
