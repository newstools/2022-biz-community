As the station hosts its 23rd annual Big Walk for Cancer, it continues making a difference in the lives of those affected and infected by cancer.Funds raised over the years have paid for among other, two transporters for cancer patients and their caregivers, as well as cancer screening and treatment equipment.“For us it is much more than the physical donations. It is about the lives that have been saved through the use of the equipment as well as the cancer awareness and education campaigns built around the Algoa FM Big Walk for Cancer,” says Algoa FM managing director Alfie Jay.The Algoa FM Big Walk for cancer will be taking place on Saturday, 29 October 2022.
