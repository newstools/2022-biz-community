These relief packages are being distributed mostly to community halls and centres that are currently accommodating families whose homes were destroyed by floods and are currently in desperate need of essential items. “KZN is the heart of Gagasi FM, and we are truly heartbroken by the devastation that the floods have brought to our province. Our contribution towards the relief of KZN’s flood victims is a protraction of our ongoing commitment towards rebuilding KZN,” says Gagasi FM managing director, Minenhle Dlamini. Gagasi FM has already visited some of the community halls in areas such as Umlazi V and G sections, as well as Entshongweni to hand over relief packages. The drive will continue with more visits in the upcoming days and weeks across various areas with people that were affected by floods. “We want to reach as many areas as possible across the province, and we have been using our different government networks to help us identify areas that need immediate assistance. We’d like to call upon NGOs to reach out to us so that we can partner in our relief efforts. We’d also like to make a plea to corporates and to our audience to please assist us by offering a helping hand or by donating towards this worthy cause,” adds Dlamini.
