Among some of the other services offered by the platform are training and mentoring programmes, keeping exporters updated on upcoming trade exhibitions, offering support with non-tariff export barriers as well as assistance with regulatory and compliance requirements.US ranked as the WCape's largest export market3 Mar 2022Wesgro has also developed a ‘Made in the Cape’ brand story, supported by a robust digital marketing roll-out, to deepen and boost the brand story of the Cape as a region of origin of quality goods and services.The campaign aims to strengthen the identity of Western Cape exports by connecting the Cape to quality through highlighting hard-hitting proof points across five products including but not limited to: rooibos (representative of Natural Products), citrus (representative of Agriculture), wine (representative of Wine and Spirits), software development (representative of Tech Innovation), and design (representative of Creative Industries).Supported by the ‘Made in the Cape’ digital brand marketing campaign, the Cape exports value proposition has reached over 7.9 million people in the United Kingdom alone between 7 March and 19 April 2022, and boasts over 81,000 hits to site.

A key priority for the Western Cape government is to ramp up our support for local exporters and to provide the right platforms for exporters to expand their global footprint. The Cape Trade Portal is one such initiative which embraces innovation to digitally connect exporters with key markets, because, at the end of the day, more exports mean more jobs in the Western Cape.”The City of Cape Town’s Mayoral Committee Member for Economic Growth, Alderman James Vos, said: "Our recovery from the pandemic must lead to a stronger, and more inclusive and sustainable economy. This means that Capetonian businesses, both existing and aspiring, must be central to our efforts. This is the very reason why the City has directed funding towards the online portal which directly connects local exporters with international buyers. These businesses also get ready access to the portal’s training platform. The Cape Trade Portal will prove to be a vital tool for the healthy growth of Cape Town’s economy."“It's encouraging to see such a positive uptake on the platform in such a short space of time. Trade promotion is key to the economic growth of the Western Cape and the virtual Cape Trade Portal is an essential piece of a larger, on-going effort to assist businesses in the province and boost their growth potential. I encourage Western Cape exporters of products and services who wish to grow their exports to become familiar with the portal and gain access to key growth markets. Wesgro continues to champion efforts to ensure that the province remains a sought-after source market globally”, concluded Wesgro CEO, Wrenelle Stander.For more, go to https://capetradeportal.com/
