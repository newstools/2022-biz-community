And, within weeks, they made the provisional space magically come to life.”Gateway is providing an interim venue for Unity which acts as a central hub for their artists - a creative space for a smorgasbord of opportunities to get involved. From painting to poetry, dance to yoga and even creative writing classes – there is something for everyone, both with experience or without.What to expect at the 48th National Arts Festival2 days ago Situated on the first floor next to CTFM, the space now sees an array of talents, from contemporary, ballet and hip hop, to some unique dance disciplines such as amapiano, burlesque and fire spinning. “Our mission is to connect local artists with the public, provide a home base for artists and to be that first-stop for people wanting to break into the Arts. The performing arts is not a closed shop, and we live that with exhibitions, open classes and dance classes,” says Unity founder, Jemma van Breda. “Content creation has been a lifeline during Covid and we’re expanding that as the demand increases.”Unity dancers and choreographers have already collaborated on several content projects for Gateway – providing a creative outlet for artists, exposure and work for several individuals who have been without during the pandemic.Image supplied: Jia Raghavjee and Priyen Naidoo perform outside at the Gateway Theatre of Shopping“As a Theatre of shopping, we love to bring our events and attractions to life through creative content sharing. Unity brings a unique perspective on visual art – its Umhlanga-style, Gateway-style, Unity-style and an all-round visual treat!” says Shelley.To get in touch with Unity and find out more about their classes, follow them on Instagram or visit their website.
