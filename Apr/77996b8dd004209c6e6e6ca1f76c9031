A 1957 Daimler Conquest Drophead Coupé | image suppliedInternational and local collectors are eagerly anticipating the auction of this Daimler, which according to High Street Auctions Cape Town Director and Auctioneer, Stef Olivier, is expected to provoke an inter-continental bidding battle that will most likely drive the sale price north of R1m. Collectors are especially eager to get their hands on this luxury car because fewer than 60 were ever made.The sale starts at noon sharp (Central African Time) in Woodstock on Saturday, 23 April. Automotive manufacturer Jaguar’s Heritage Trust website confirms the extremely low number of Daimler Conquest Drophead Coupés manufactured, as well as the fact that for decades it has remained one of the rarest Daimlers in the world.The site also notes that when these exclusive sports cars were sold new 65 years ago, their price tag of £1,895 was equivalent to 202 weeks average pay in the UK.Olivier says the specific coupé going under the hammer on Saturday has been authenticated through matching engine and VIN numbers, “something upon which we insisted because in our wildest dreams we never thought we’d see a real 1957 Daimler Conquest Drophead Coupé come up for auction.“In fact, very few ever left the UK and as far as we know, this is the only one in South Africa.”He says it’s extremely difficult to estimate the current value of the Daimler because research has revealed only two other auctions of 1957 Daimler Conquest Drophead Coupés around the world in the past 10 years.1968 Triumph Bond Equipe GTOlivier says another stand-out lot in Saturday’s auction is the 1968 Triumph Bond Equipe GT.At the time, for its UK manufacturer, the Equipe GT’s sleek, sporty design was revolutionary; described by one aficionado as “a Ford Cortina II-meets-Singer Chamois, with a bit of Aston Martin DBS thrown in”.The major departure for Bond was the addition to the Equipe of Triumph’s compact straight-six-cylinder engine, which offered drivers 160km/h on the floor and a 0-100km/h time of around 12 seconds.1968 Triumph Bond Equipe GTThe model’s designer sportiness was also reflected in the launch price tag, which at £1 095 was equivalent to a year’s average gross household income in the UK in 1968, according to the British Department of Labour.Olivier says the 1968 Triumph Bond Equipe GT going under the hammer this weekend is licensed and has a Certificate of Roadworthiness.36-year-old Alfa Romeo sells for R1.1m at South African auction6 Dec 2021“This siren red sensation is as striking today as it was when it first came to market 54 years ago and best of all, after the auction the new owner will able to get behind the wheel and power his new baby straight off the lot, because it runs like a dream.”Olivier says among the oldest cars on auction will be a 1928 Austin 16-6 Doctors Coupe, a 1928 Willys Whippet Truck and a 1931 Ford Model-T.“Another vehicle attracting a lot of bidder interest is the 1970 VW split-window Combi. I think over the years ‘Volksie buses’ have become as much part of South Africa’s cultural DNA as boerewors and as such there’s huge nostalgia among collectors.“The split-window combis are rare, though, and therefore command much higher prices when they come up for auction. We expect spirited bidding on this lot.”Olivier says Saturday’s dual auction will be both live at 179 Albert Road in Woodstock, Cape Town, as well as virtually live-streamed to bidders across the world on High Street’s website, as well as on the company’s social media channels, YouTube and the High Street app.“I will be accepting bids from the floor, telephonic bids, as well as bids via the app and other pre-arranged digital platforms. It’s also essential to pre-register to be part of this once-in-a-lifetime auction. Only registered bidders will be allowed to participate in the sale.”All registration details as well as the download link for the full auction catalogue can be found here.
