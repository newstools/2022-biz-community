The researchers found a situation whereby Black working-class communities are bearing the burden of the electricity crisis. SA's economic growth affected by mismatch of electricity supply and demandBy Roula Inglesi-Lotz 13 Apr 2022Townships neglected by EskomIt demonstrates how, in addition to load shedding, Black working-class communities suffer from load reduction - "a racist policy of targeting Black areas for power failures aimed at reducing South Africa’s energy demand given Eskom’s inability to cope", said the university in a media release.The report also provides evidence of how areas where the Black working-class live are neglected by Eskom and the authorities when it comes to maintenance, service complaints, response to repair callouts, etc. The report suggests that the neglect of the energy needs of the working class and the poor is a continuation of past racist policies.
