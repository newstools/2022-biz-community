Issues facing the country’s dire economic state such as the alarmingly high youth unemployment rate reported to be at 66.5% in the fourth quarter of 2021, and undoubtedly exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, means that solutions which focus on strengthening start-ups and providing practical business skills training should be more available and accessible now than ever before. Over the next 2-years, participants of the Innovator Trust’s Start-Up Programme will receive mentorship, skills development training and the necessary support to sustain and boost the growth of the start-ups.

With other programmes, you usually find they have a specific focus but this is so well-rounded,” says Katlego Malatji, 29 years old, based in Soshanguve, owner of Project One Engineering.  “We really wanted to be a part of the Start-Up programme to share our story, to motivate others and show what we’ve done and where we are. We come from nothing. We didn’t go to school for what we are doing now but both Nkululeko and I are in this industry because we are passionate about change and bringing about that change using technology,” says Mamello Mofokeng, Nkululeko Ndumiso, co-owners of Saturated Agency.
