So, if you’re keen to participate, you’ll have to jump. But not only because mushrooms only appear for a short time after the winter’s first rains, when conditions are just right. In fact, it’s because the Delheim Wild Mushroom Forage will take place for members of the public on one day only on 16 June. If you miss it, however, there’s another way. An additional day is planned for 2 July, but it’s reserved for members of the estate’s wine club.  Eat Out survey reveals post-pandemic dining trends22 Apr 2022 Signed-up foragers will again learn at the hand of the host duo that has made this a highlight of the Cape winelands for 15 years. Delheim’s Nora Thiel was raised in a home that regularly foraged for mushrooms and she’ll be joined by author and specialist Gary Goldman.  Participating groups have been limited to just 30 people, so an intimate and first-hand experience in this pop-up event is assured. Each ticket includes the presentation about foraging and mushroom varieties, which covers those to be avoided and those that are edible; the forage excursion into Delheim’s forest; and, a three-course, mushroom-inspired lunch served with wines from the estate.
