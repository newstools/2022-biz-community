The first eco-friendly jungle gym made from its recycled wipes was donated to Qedusizi Day Care Centre in Brakpan, east of Johannesburg last week. The jungle gym donated to the day care centre was manufactured by Hudson Diphofa, an entrepreneur who operates his business from his home in Katlehong. Having worked in the sustainable manufacturing field for more than five years, Diphofa established Structural Poly Plastic Furniture & Project in 2020 after he was retrenched because of the Covid-19 pandemic. His business uses recycled material to manufacture outdoor furniture products.   Recycling grows in Africa, creating job and business opportunities18 Mar 2022Sani-touch marketing director Annette Devenish says this is the culmination of a long journey to ensure that its used wipes are recycled. “Creating a circular economy is about more than just sending products to recyclers. Although recyclers are an important part of the process, the reality is that they are only part of the process.  “Our goal is to ensure that Sani-touch’s wipes don’t end up in landfill but instead get recycled and manufactured into a bench, jungle gym or pallet that can be used over and over again,” Devenish says. Devenish adds that businesses can no longer afford to pay only lip service to the concept of recycling or wait for legislation to apply to them. “We all have to step up and play our part to ensure that used products are recycled, repurposed and become part of a sustainable system. Together we can make a difference to create a better world,” Devenish concludes.
