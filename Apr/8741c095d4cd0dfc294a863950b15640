The planned suspension of load shedding is due, in part, to the lower demand expected over the weekend.“However, there remains a possibility that load shedding will need to be implemented during next week as the demand returns,” Eskom said.Eskom plans to undertake opportunity maintenance during the low-demand weekend to address any further risk on running units. It will also be releasing some water into the river system from the Ingula Pumped Storage Scheme in order to relieve the capacity constraints that have been created by the heavy rains.
