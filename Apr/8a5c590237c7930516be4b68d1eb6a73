Through these face-to-face engagements, the Commission is also able to interact with members in their home language as some awareness material is now available vernacular.  The Competition Commission is one of three independent institutions established in terms of the Competition Act (89 of 1998) alongside the Competition Tribunal and The Competition Appeal Court. The Commission is empowered to investigate, control and evaluate restrictive business practices, abuse of dominant positions and mergers in order to achieve equity and efficiency in the South African economy.  The stated purpose of the Competition Act is to promote and maintain competition in South Africa in order to achieve the following outcomes: To promote the efficiency, adaptability and development of the economy; To provide consumers with competitive prices and product choices; To promote employment and advance the social and economic welfare of South Africans; To expand opportunities for South African participation in world markets and recognise the role of foreign competition in the Republic; To ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises have an equitable opportunity to participate in the economy; and To promote a greater spread of ownership, in particular to increase the ownership stakes of historically disadvantaged persons.Members of the public, the media, consumer groups and other stakeholders will have six (6) days of open interactions through which to better understand the mandate and role of the Commission in the attainment of a growing, deconcentrated, and inclusive economy.Visit the Competition Commission’s stand to learn more about the work of the Commission and how you can help promote competition in the market by reporting anti-competitive conduct.
