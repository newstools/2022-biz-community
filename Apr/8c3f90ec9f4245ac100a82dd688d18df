Diemuodeke 14 Mar 2022Nigeria almost entirely dependent on fuel importsDangote, who built his fortune in the cement industry, first announced the intention to build a refinery in 2013, with the project expected to be finished in 2016.The billionaire then moved the site to Lekki in Lagos, upgraded the size and said production would start in early 2020.Despite being Africa's biggest oil producer and exporter, Nigeria depends almost entirely on fuel imports after allowing its significant refining capacity of 445,000 bpd to become dilapidated over several decades.Last month Dangote commissioned a $2.5bn fertiliser plant, located within his refinery and petrochemical complex, which is already exporting urea to the United States, India, Brazil, Mexico and Argentina.
