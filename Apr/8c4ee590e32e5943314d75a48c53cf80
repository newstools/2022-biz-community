The Stay Fresh™ adult toothpaste range has also been certified vegan. The new-look packaging is expected to filter through to the shelf in the second quarter of 2022. The Stay Fresh™ adult toothpaste range includes extra xylitol fluoride protection with zinc, mint, fluoride and xylitol. Zinc and mint reduce bad breath, and fluoride and xylitol give extra protection against plaque and strengthen teeth.Jordan Fresh Breath has the added component of Optafresh®, clinically proven to reduce oral malodour. Specifically, zinc destroys bad breath by reducing the volatile sulphur compounds in the mouth that cause it. The mint injects a cool freshness, while fluoride and xylitol safely and effectively bolster teeth delivering up to 12 hours of freshness.Jordan Cavity Defence and Jordan White Smile round-off the Stay Fresh™ range, both having been independently tested. While they respectively tackle specifically cavities and colour, no damage is caused to the enamel and is safe for daily use. In addition, Jordan Cavity Defence contains almost 10% xylitol, which, when combined with fluoride, delivers significantly higher remineralisation - or strengthening - of teeth.Jordan White Smile is aimed at removing daily stains, even from such intense colourants as tea and coffee, for naturally whiter teeth as well as gum protection. With the new advanced whitening formula, one can get whiter teeth in just 1 week after regular use.
