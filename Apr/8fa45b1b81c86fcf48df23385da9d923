In 2015, the EPC standard (SANS 1544:2015) was published. Therefore, building managers and owners should not be surprised that the EPC regulations were implemented in December 2020, leaving them with two years to get everything sorted.Of course, there are a host of things owners and property managers can do to improve the efficiency rating of the building. For instance, replacing the incandescent light bulbs with LED lighting, replacing geysers with heat pumps if they use hot water, optimising the setpoints of the air-conditioning system, insulating the building thoroughly, and encouraging the use of stairs to mitigate the use of elevators.This is where the importance of having an accredited EPC inspection body to guide the property owner through the process becomes critical. Both the Sanas and Sanedi websites provide a list of possible service providers.Regardless of the approach taken, those who have not yet started the process best begin soon or face significant penalties come December this year.
