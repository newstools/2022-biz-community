IceTech is a software developer focused predominantly on the digitisation of government in emerging markets. IceTech approached the Matt Brown Show media house, to help raise awareness of their brand, educate the market about its technology solutions and to get the IceTech story in front of new customers in both the public and private sector across the African continent.The solution was to launch a branded interview on the Matt Brown Show media platforms to discuss the backstory to the IceTech brand, and shine a light on their proprietary technology platform 'the Ice Engine' a powerful system engine that drives business processes in a dynamic and integrated way. The once-off interview was hosted by #1 Amazon Best Selling author and host of the Matt Brown Show, Matt Brown, and Ice Tech CEO Greg Morris and head of sales and marketing Dimitri Kanellopoulos. The interview was branded as an Ice Tech TV show and was shot in only 60 minutes. Sound bites were created from the interview and were published on LinkedIn, YouTube, Facebook and the Matt Brown Show podcast.
