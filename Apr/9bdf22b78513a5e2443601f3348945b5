Source: SuppliedThe song was co-written with Craig Hinds, Howie’s previous band member and frontman of the band Watershed. "I See You celebrates defeating the odds despite the challenges faced along the way. It is a song about empathy and understanding.  Communicating with a girl who has gone through trauma and abuse, recognising the pain she has endured, understanding her difficulties and offering her the reassurance that no matter what happens she is not alone,” says Combrink.The song inspires individuals to embrace life despite what they are going through or what their circumstances are. It encourages people to move forward, progressing one step at a time each day and to make the decision to rise up, take responsibility and live their best life.I See You forms part of Rada’s third music album ‘Rada Unearthed Vol.2’, released through Rada Inspirational.
