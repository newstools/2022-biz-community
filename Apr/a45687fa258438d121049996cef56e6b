We have offered some assistance to municipalities in KZN to help with spares and maintenance crews.KZN's Hazelmere Dam wall intact, emergency evacuation plan activated19 hours agoLoad sheddingDe Ruyter said the power utility is down on capacity of about 13,663MW which will result in the power utility falling short – by some 3,518MW – of consumer demand.“We had to take a decision to extend load shedding... at least until Friday, depending on how the situation changes with units either returning to service from unplanned trips or potential further breakdowns and, of course, that risk remains,” he said.Breakdowns and trips at the power utility’s power stations include:A shutdown at Komati power station unit nine.A trip at Majuba Power Station’s unit six.An interruption at the Apollo substation, which transmits at least 220MW electricity imported from Mozambique’s Cahora Bassa hydroelectric power station.A unit tripped at Grootvlei Power Station.A unit was lost at Camden Power Station.A boiler tube leak tripped the Medupi Power Station’s unit two.SA's economic growth affected by mismatch of electricity supply and demandBy Roula Inglesi-Lotz 18 hours agoFurthermore, units at risk are in excess of 11,000MW of power.Turning to the power utility’s emergency reserve capacity, De Ruyter said Eskom is not currently burning any diesel at its emergency and peak-hour generating power station, Ankerlig.“We have been able to keep Ankerlig diesel supply stable. We have about 28 hours left at the power station but, of course, we have to maintain that reserve in the event that there are further losses of more generation units. We have to keep a buffer in order to prevent an overall system blackout.“At Gourikwa power station… we are currently running five units and we’ve got 35 hours of generating capacity with diesel levels sitting at just over 83%,” he said.The power utility’s water-pumped storage facility in Drakensburg has 57 hours of generation capacity and Ingula Pumped Storage Scheme, which has been affected by heavy rain, has some 24 hours' generation capacity.Former Eskom officer, supplier get 20-year sentence31 Mar 2022Protecting emergency reserves“We anticipate that we will require 11 open cycle gas turbines to get us through this evening’s peak [and] again, we appeal to South African public to please be responsible in how they manage their electricity consumption. It makes a difference and it will really help us to protect those emergency reserves.“We require, in order to provide for any unforeseen events, reserves of about 2,200MW and therefore we do need to preserve diesel and maintain our dam levels. We can’t simply run them to depletion and take a risk of coal-fired units tripping, which would then create a very risky situation for us in terms of the overall grid stability,” he said.
