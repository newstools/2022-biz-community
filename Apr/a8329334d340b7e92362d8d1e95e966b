To Lite’n up the bar staff’s weekend as well as yours, Castle Lite will be tipping bar staff R5 for every 500ml Castle Lite draught served at participating outlets from Friday 29 April to Monday 2 May, and they are calling on South Africa to raise your glasses in support. “Tips on Tap is an initiative about extending the enjoyment to our most loved bar staff this Workers' Day weekend. We wanted to ensure that South Africa’s bar staff, who will be working over the public holidays, get the extra support they deserve, they are the ones working to ensure you get served a perfect, extra-cold draught after all,” says Colleen Duvenage, brand director at Castle Lite. All you have to do to be a part of this worthwhile initiative is to visit your nearest participating outlet, purchase an extra cold 500ml Castle Lite draught, and Castle Lite will tip the bar staff R5, it’s that easy to spread the enjoyment this workers day weekend! “To make it as convenient as possible for every South African of legal drinking age to get involved with this initiative and to maximise our efforts to hit our tip target of over a R1m we have selected outlets all across South Africa. That means wherever you are enjoying your long weekend, you can find a participating outlet and spread the enjoyment. “We understand that our restaurants and bars are still recovering from the last few years and we as Castle Lite wanted to show support for them, especially highlighting our skilled bar staff and the hard work they put in day after day.”If you’re unable to make it to one of the participating outlets over the long weekend, you can keep your eyes on Castle Lite’s social pages for more ways in which to engage with the campaign, spread the enjoyment, and play your part to ensure the SA’s bar staff get the recognition they deserve.This Workers' Day choose Castle Lite, the beer that tips your bar staff.
