Has South Africa turned its back on apprenticeships?7 Mar 2022Making BIM qualifications accessible“The institute wants to make BIM qualifications accessible and affordable to the masses, targeting high school graduates, TVET graduates and professionals who wish to curve a new career path in BIM,” says Mashudu Madzhie, interim CEO of the institute.He explains that only high-end BIM workshops have been available locally, and most of them are only accessible to those with many years of experience in engineering or construction. “The institute's mission is to educate students on specific industry knowledge using innovative, technology-rich, interdisciplinary learning environments. The institute will collaborate with industry partners to offer students real-world problem-solving, work experience, applied research, and business leadership opportunities to achieve this mission,” Madzhie says.Sanral scholarship and bursary programme open for applications23 Feb 2022BIM programmesThe institute's frst BIM programmes will focus on its application in construction management and facilities management.“The institute's qualifications will train students on the largely developing field of BIM and related concepts and technical know-how of the ever-changing software used in the construction and facilities management areas,” says Lukenge. “At the end of the qualifications, students will be able to use modelling techniques, 3D modelling tools and computer-aided design (CAD). Students will be able to carry out accurate calculations on construction and facilities management projects, specifically when it comes to detailed measurement of materials and labour needed before and after a construction project,” Lukenge explains.Potential opportunity for women lies in artisan skills shortage5 Aug 2021Programme accreditationThe programmes will be recognised locally with SAQA and CHE accreditations, and with international professional bodies such as the British Standards Institution (BSI) with which the inistitute is exploring partnership possibilities. “The partnership will mean that our students will graduate with a locally accredited programme and access to the BSI professional membership via our partnership and programme endorsement with the BSI group, which sets local and global standards in BIM and related fields,” says Lukenge.Madzhie says that the issue of affordability is paramount to what the institute wants to achieve. Because of this commitment, the board of directors of the institute and the trustees of Nido Trust have agreed to offer the Henry Lukenge Fellowship and Nido Trust Bursaries to deserving students, both of which will be available from 2023.
