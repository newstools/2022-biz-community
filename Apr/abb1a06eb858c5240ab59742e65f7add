Baele (Project Manager: Ministry of Transportation and Communication) Mr Hein Barnard (Business Manager: Enterprises University of Pretoria), Ms Gillian Michalowski (Assistant Project Manager: Enterprises University of Pretoria), Dr Paulo Fernandes (Project Manager: Enterprises University of Pretoria), in Botswana.Through a World Bank tender process, the Government of the Republic of Botswana appointed Enterprises University of Pretoria (Enterprises UP) to assess the current skills and other challenges faced by the construction sector (civil works), and thereafter prepare and implement a training plan for selected topics, as well as recommendations for industry improvement.This initiative will serve as the foundation for the industry's growth and performance, enabling it to manage the country's current and future needs while also contributing to economic growth. Enterprises UP has conducted research, had stakeholder engagement workshops, and implemented identified training initiatives.This project was carried out in two phases: first, an industry analysis was conducted, followed by a plan of action for the local construction sector, and finally, members of the construction industry, consultants, and government officials were trained. The project's training component focused on ten topics, including Project Management, Procurement and Tendering Procedures, Financial Management for Contractors, and Safe Road Design short courses.The report resulting from the research project will form a basis for the industry's growth and performance, with scope, time, and cost assisting the constructor, consultant, and client.According to Mr Orapeleng Mosigi, the Director of Transport Policy and Planning at the Ministry of Transport and Communications, this project would enable the construction industry to meet Botswana's current and future needs, therefore contributing to economic growth.Forging ahead, it is critical that government officials, contractors, and consultants work together to execute high-quality construction projects. The research also clearly demonstrates how the construction industry as a whole plays a critical role in economic development and job creation, as well as the importance of an industry that embraces innovation and technological improvement in order to remain competitive in the global market.The project's final activity was a stakeholder feedback session on 10 March 2022, at the Cresta President Hotel in Gaborone.
