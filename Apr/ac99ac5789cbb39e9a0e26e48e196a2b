The agency can overlay their scores with a potential client in a certain industry’s needs for a good fit up front making the new business process that much easier and faster.“The ability to drill down into the data in a simple way allows the user to conduct a cross-analysis, by clicking on sections such as the job title and role of interviewees in decision making; the sector and category of participating companies and the city in which they’re based; and the evolution of the company from the previous Agency Scope.”Vacchiano notes that being able to review your performance against the entire market as well as your closest competition gives subscribing agencies an edge that is likely to be reflected in business performance in the years to come.”.
