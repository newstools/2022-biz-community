Produced by Egg Films’ Zwelethu Radebe, in collaboration with the team at Ogilvy Johannesburg, the TVC is an  inspirational piece of storytelling that is a moving reminder that even the very best are nothing without others. Radebe takes us on a journey through time to relive the moments that shaped award winning rapper and songwriter Chana - his neighbour, teacher, friends, and those he worked with in studio, everyone who played a pivotal role in his career. These people are the legends behind the legend, those who made him who he is today.After spending the past six month directing a series for Netflix, Radebe says he was excited to return to commercials and the opportunity to truly flex and hone his emotive storytelling abilities. A greater message“An important aspect to  Chana’s journey is those who have played a role in his upbringing. There’s a greater message that’s being told through Lunch Bar and  Chana; it is a story of upliftment, never giving up and never losing your child like imagination,” Radebe says.  Ogilvy Johannesburg creative directors, Clint Bechus änd Coenie Grebe weigh in: “Describing what Radebe brought to this advert would be a mistake, as it is really something that needs to be experienced. He got the most out of the talent, brought the journey to life and captured the soul of each time period. “Most importantly, he had a ‘vision’ for the sound. By putting his passion for music into the piece, he created something unique and to hear it in all its glory is something else. It’s great to work with someone so positive who has a vision for an advert from pre-prod to post."
