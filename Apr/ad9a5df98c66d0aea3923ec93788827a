South Africa’s largest commercial youth radio station introduces its audience to an audio-only drama, speaking to the essence of ‘theatre of the mind’.  Tequila AF, created and directed by Y content producer Lumko Johnson, brings a storyline of murder, and explores themes of friendship, loyalty and mental illness. Says Johnson: “My late great grandmother introduced me to radio through radio dramas she loved and followed. We didn’t have a TV at the time, I must’ve been four or five and we would gather and listen to the Xhosa stories every night before bed. I trust and believe in this story and commend Y for introducing something so cool to its audience.” “Y is more than a radio offering. After the success of The Banques and Venom Show, we are confident in our abilities to produce content for all platforms and Tequila AF is our second project, with more following soon,” said Phindi Ziqubu, Y’s content manager. “Our research has shown an undeniable demand amongst younger audiences for this kind of content. Y has been deliberate in ensuring we enter the podcast space with something unique and which is not simply a repurposing of what we produce on-air. Content produced by the station will be available exclusively on the YFM app, before it is released on other platforms,” says Hilton Tarrant, Y’s digital manager. The drama stars up-and-coming actors Andisiwe Mpinda (as Sibu), Makoto Phumodi (as Pasi), Mmathapelo Bodibe (as Pearl), Tshepo Ramasia (as Thabiso) and Freddy Mabitsela (as Zee). Tequila AF is available from 20 April on the YFM app, with new episodes releasing every Wednesday. Download the app in the App Store or Google Play. Episodes will also be available on Thursdays on all major podcast platforms, including Apple Podcasts, Spotify and Google Podcasts.Listen here:Your browser does not support the audio tag.
