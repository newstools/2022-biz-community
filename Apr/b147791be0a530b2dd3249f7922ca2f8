Love or hate the tradition, here’s a round-up of interesting pranks concocted by retail brands this year.WoolworthsWoolies announced the launch of a rather unsavoury new snack, combining two of its most popular products to create Rotisserie Chicken-flavoured Chuckles.We’re excited to announce our newest Chuckles creation – Rotisserie Chicken-flavoured Chuckles! Think malt balls infused with delectable rotisserie chicken flavour, enrobed in rich, creamy milk chocolate. Slightly savoury, complemented by deliciously sweet… It’s a winner! pic.twitter.com/kW9dmtfHGL— Woolworths SA (@WOOLWORTHS_SA) April 1, 2022 “We’re excited to announce our newest Chuckles creation – Rotisserie Chicken-flavoured Chuckles! Think malt balls infused with delectable rotisserie chicken flavour, enrobed in rich, creamy milk chocolate. Slightly savoury, complemented by deliciously sweet… It’s a winner!”The post was later edited to say “ONLY JOKING! Our Chuckles Rotisserie chicken flavoured malted puffs in milk chocolate were just an idea to make you smile.”OneDayOnlyOneDayOnly’s April Fool’s gag saw the online daily deals retailer advertising a 140m-long ‘Oligarch’s Megayacht’ for R10m, priced down from R100m. The prank was a clever reference to Russian oligarchs – rich business people who rapidly accumulated wealth in the 1990s following the dissolution of the Soviet Union – who are being sanctioned and are losing their fortunes due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Source: SuppliedThe ad read, “It’s 140 [metres] long and jam packed with the kind of luxuries only Autocrats can dream of. If you’re not welcome in Europe, no problem, with a range of 7000 miles you can sail the world with 40 of your closest Oligarch Mates in this floating resort. You could even sail it from The Crimea to South Africa where you’d be sure to get a warm welcome from your old Comrades.  “You could even host them for a ‘not an invasion or a war at all’ party (BOYB). The mini submarine (and especially the 4 tenders) will be sure to get your guests excited. Think how amazed they’ll be when you turn the dance floor into a (fire)pool with one touch of a gold-plated button.“Available for collection in Marina di Carrara in northern Tuscany (if you can find a morally-ambivalent crew).”The prank was for a good cause, however, as shoppers were encouraged to support the humanitarian efforts in Ukraine by making a financial donation to disaster relief NGO Gift of the Givers. Those looking to donate had the option of donating R50, R100, R200 or R600.“This is a gag deal in celebration of April Fool's Day. Instead, by purchasing this deal, you will be making a donation to a good cause,” the ad stated.

View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Game Stores SA (@gamestores_sa) The retailer said it partnered with comedians to design the prank, and the #GameGotYou hashtag used for the prank was a play on the brand’s pay-off line ‘Game’s Got You’.FairviewWine farm and cheese manufacturer Fairview jokingly revealed a new cannabis-infused camembert called ‘Muncheese’ rich in both CBD and THC, it announced on Facebook.“After attaining a grower’s license from the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (Sahpra) at the back end of 2021, Fairview prepared and planted a 2ha field with cannabis sativa. The majority of the yield was to be exported and utilized in the production of various medicinal marijuana products. Enter the Fairview goat herd…“Early one morning the herd of milking goats escaped from their paddock and made their way to the hidden cannabis plantation. They grazed excessively and within a few hours, the once thriving 2ha cannabis field, had essentially disappeared!" Fairview quipped.Source: SuppliedIt said that side effects of consuming the cheese included lowered pain, lowered anxiety, increased sense of humour and colourful hallucinations. “As luck would have it, a loophole in the legislation governing dairy production allows Fairview to produce products from the cannabis-infused goats’ milk!”OrosBeverage brand Oros shared on Friday that it was expanding in the breakfast category with the launch of Oros-flavoured flakes.“OH OH OH Yes!
