The Rand Show, previously Rand Easter Show has always been a not to miss experience, not just for Gauteng residents but visitors from neighboring provinces as well. Gauteng Tourism has over the past months marketed Rand Show in Botswana, during the Gauteng Events Golf Day recently held at Soweto Country Club and assisted in institutionalizing safe events protocols in Gauteng which will be activated at the Rand Show. The 2022 edition promises to go down as the Best Rand Show in the last few decades. For the next 6 days visitors can expect all day entertainment for kids, a-list artist performances, fashion, food market, the old school carnival rides and more. Gauteng Tourism Chief Executive Officer, Ms. Sthembiso Dlamini says the hosting of events will go a long way as an interventionist strategy anchored by the national tourism sector recovery to rejuvenate and reignite the visitor economy broadly. “Events will continue to form part of the domestic tourism strategy to drive visitation to the province because events attract visitors into a city or region who would not have otherwise visited for any other reason,” Dlamini adds.
