Only 30 minutes from the city centre, the new campus, which currently hosts more than 4500 students, offers a vibrant, dynamic and multi-cultured environment. The Newlands campus, centred around the iconic cricket grounds, is a modern and vibrant space with state-of-the-art learning facilities, and is surrounded by cafes, restaurants, coffee shops and businesses as well as a market and museum. It is easily reachable by train, car, taxi, bicycle or on foot. There is direct access to the Newlands train station and a bicycle garage, for the more ‘carbon conscious’ students. To assist those students in residence, The IIE’s School of Hospitality and Service Management and DigsConnect have forged a strategic partnership to alleviate any potential student accommodation challenges and provide students with an online platform where they can access safe accommodation options within an 8km radius of the campus. Says The IIE SHSM’s MD Renee Hill: “This is a bold, new step for The IIE’s School of Hospitality and Service Management as it represents a firm commitment and proactive step towards ensuring that, wherever possible, all IIE students receive equitable and maximised access to the best facilities and resources the group has to offer.”
