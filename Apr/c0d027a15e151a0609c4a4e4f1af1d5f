Why Netflix believes Africa is a good investmentBy Danette Breitenbach 30 Mar 2022 With no Amazon Prime countries in Africa, Amazon Prime Video is forecast to have 2.18 million paying subscribers by 2027.Simon Murray, principal analyst at Digital TV Research, says: “Disney+ will only have a limited roll-out: South Africa (2022) and Nigeria (2023). We do not think that Paramount+, HBO Max or Peacock will start as standalone platforms in Africa. HBO will continue its distribution deal with Showmax.”“Francophone MyCanal started as a free add-on for Canal Plus pay TV subscribers in 2021. In our last forecasts, we expected MyCanal to be a standalone platform. We now do not believe that this will happen. This will stifle SVOD growth in the Francophone countries.”The report covers movie and TV episode developments with detailed country-by-country analysis and forecasts for 35 countries
