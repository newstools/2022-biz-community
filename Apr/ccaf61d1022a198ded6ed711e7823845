Nissan SA last registered a three-row Go+ as long ago as November 2021, along with 105 units of the Go in the same month. That figure fell to 47 in December 2021, 27 in January 2022, 14 in February and just 7 in March. The four-strong Go budget hatchback had been priced from R184,600 to R213 800, while the three-variant Go+ line-up had run from R194,700 to R223,800.A few years back, Datsun had plans to launch a new budget-beating crossover locally, but that vehicle didn’t ever materialise. Instead, the Nissan-badged Magnite – which was originally destined to wear the Datsun insignia – was introduced to South Africa in April 2021.The first Datsun was produced way back in 1931, before the badge disappeared in 1986. After a 27-year hiatus, Nissan announced the revival of the marque as a budget sub-brand for emerging markets in mid-2013. The Go, however, had a rocky start, being handed a zero-star crash-test safety rating by Global NCAP the following year.This article was originally published on Cars.co.za.
