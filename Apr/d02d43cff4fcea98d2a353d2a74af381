Not just because of the important role it plays within its local district, but also for its ability to reach local audiences. This view that regional and community based radio are relatable because they are rooted within area they serve, a trusted and crucial voice for the people, is why MediaHeads 360 is committed to its development. That's also why MediaHeads 360 is very excited to be able to invest in local community station, Alex FM, with a donation of studio equipment to assist them with their podcast strategy."On behalf of Alex FM and the community that we serve, we want to thank MediaHeads 360 for their great gesture and kind donation to the station to help us get our voice back following the July 2021 unrest that saw the station being looted and equipment stolen. It is partnerships like this that give us hope to continue being the voice the for the voiceless and of course our mandate to educate, inform and entertain. It helps us to continue to avail a platform to young people in the community so we can ready them for work. We are so thankful for this."
