“This busy period requires a collaboration of all stakeholders EMS, SAPS, Metro Police, and us in hospitals. Our hospital teams from doctors and A&E teams are prepared and ready to work hand in hand with our provincial emergency reaction teams during this period and beyond,” said Joe Sandows, Botshelong Hospital manager. Clinix Health Group hospitals boast a 24hr Accident and Emergency Unit which delivers high standards of service for critically ill or injured persons who need urgent medical attention servicing across the various municipalities where our hospitals are based. In preparation for the long weekend, Clinix Botshelong Hospital, situated in Vosloorus, directly next to the N3 exit hosted EMS, Metro Police, and SAPS for a lunch and prayer session to offer encouragement and support to the teams ahead of the long hours. “It’s not easy for them to leave their homes at all kinds of hours to be on the roads, in hospitals, and help other citizens to reach their destinations to see their loved ones. We hope this small gesture of encouragement and support can truly show our appreciation for all the emergency teams in and around our community,” concluded Joe Sandows.About Clinix Health GroupIn 1992 the company employed less than five people who led our first hospital Botshelong Empilweni Private Hospital to open its doors to the Vosloorus community in 1994.
