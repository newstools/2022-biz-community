At the same time, the National Government has announced that they will finalise regulations under the National Health Act, which are due to be finalised on 16 April 2022."The Western Cape Government is closely studying these draft regulations and will strongly oppose any efforts to sneak unnecessary measures back in. Our response will continue to be guided by the best possible scientific advice based on the latest available evidence," Winde said"We should continue to stay safe by practising the golden rules of good hygiene. We should also protect those at risk of severe disease, by acting responsibly, and we should get vaccinated, if we haven’t yet been able to."
