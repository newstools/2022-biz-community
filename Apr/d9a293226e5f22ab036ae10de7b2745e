Cannabis has always had a reputation of being a miracle herb in traditional healing methods and has been used and cultivated by mankind for at least 6000 years.2CBD, which stands for cannabidiol, is a chemical compound from the Cannabis Sativa plant. While CBD is an essential component of medical marijuana, it is derived directly from the hemp plant – a cousin of the marijuana plant.3, 4 Contrary to what some may believe, CBD is entirely free of THC or tetrahydrocannabinol, which means you can enjoy all the natural health benefits of cannabis without the disadvantage of any psychoactive effects.4 With the popularity of CBD health products blooming, it's natural to wonder what CBD is, and more importantly, what benefits this gift from nature possesses. Anyone interested in understanding the role and significance of CBD must first understand the human endocannabinoid system's functioning (ECS).5 The ECS can be thought of as the body's air traffic control centre. It controls physiological processes, including appetite and pain sensation. The ECS consists of two primary cannabinoid receptors: CB1 receptors (most concentrated in the central nervous system and brain) and CB2 receptors (abundant in the  immunological tissues and modulate cell fate).5 The natural cannabinoids and phytonutrients found in CBD communicate with these signal receptors of the ECS to provide an effective way to reduce pain, inflammation, stress, sleep disorders, and much more.6Introducing ADCO CBDThis ground-breaking research into the different forms of CBD led pharmaceutical company Adcock Ingram to launch the ADCO CBD range of products.
