I am certain that you will be the best ambassadors ever for this University, the Faculty, and the Department.""The leadership with Prof Harris is exceptional; you are honoured to be working so closely with such an industry thought leader," Mr Herbst said as he addressed the team.Covid-19 provided UPCT the opportunity to diversify their services and create a more exciting way of showcasing the University of Pretoria's past and promising future.

There are virtual tours of all of the University of Pretoria's campuses accessible.Prof Karen Harris expressed gratitude to Enterprises UP for their ongoing support, stating that “We were the first adopted programme by Enterprises UP.
