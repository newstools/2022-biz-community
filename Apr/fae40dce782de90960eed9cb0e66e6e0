The spelling bee competition attracts Grade 4 learners from all over KwaZulu-Natal who are eager to show off their brain power.  This year’s campaign launches on 25 April and will run for four weeks in partnership with Sasko as the main sponsor. Each week, from Monday to Thursday, three kids will be chosen to compete against each other over the phone. The first week will kick off on 3 May. The daily winners for that week will then compete against each other on the Friday. The weekly winner automatically advances to the grand finale, which is set to take place live on the Breakfast Show with Darren, Keri, and Sky on 24 May 2022. There are also loads of prizes to be won, including R25,000 that will go towards the learner’s school fees. Last year’s winner, Jemimah Elise Sampson from Whetstone Primary, could not contain her excitement after being crowned KwaZulu-Natal’s spelling champion. “I am elated, excited, and the happiest, best student ever!” she said after beating five other Grade 4 learners in the finale.
