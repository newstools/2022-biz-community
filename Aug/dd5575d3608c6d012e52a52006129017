It will also be used secondarily for ancillary services and local network support. There are also several technical applications and benefits that will be quantifiable over time. Charging of the batteries will take place during off-peak periods or when the network conditions permit,” the power utility said.Eskom in talks with Botswana about importing power28 Jul 2022Two phasesEskom added that the BESS project will be implemented in two phases and is “designed to utilise large-scale utility batteries with the capacity of 1,440MWh per day and a 60MW solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity”.“Phase 1 includes the installation of approximately 199MW additional capacity. With four hours of storage, this equals 833MWh storage of distributed battery storage plants at eight Eskom distribution substation sites. This phase also includes about 2MW of solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity.“Phase 2 includes the installation of a total of 144MW which is equivalent to 616MWh at four Eskom distribution sites and one transmission site. The solar PV capacity in this phase is 58MW,” Eskom said.
