The event has gained a family of followers over the past eight years and aims to present some of the latest and most loved craft brews at the upcoming eventImage supplied: Pouring drinks at the Stellenbosch Craft Beer Festival.SCBF organiser Dirkie van der Merwe says, “We as a beer loving community are relishing the opportunity to celebrate being together again and being able to crack a cold one with like-minded people under the 200 -year old pine trees in the Jan Marais Nature Reserve.” The craft beer experience has taken micro brewing and micro distilling to a new level in recent years. We now see the emergence of not only craft gin, but also agave-based spirits, rum, mead and much more. The SCBF has played a major role in creating a platform for these artisans to exhibit their products. Visitors are encouraged to test their pallets and try new varieties. This year, the event will also for the first time include a non-alcoholic cocktail bar, with a selection of fresh-pressed juice-based cocktails.
