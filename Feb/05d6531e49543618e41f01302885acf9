Other categories, including artisans and officials, would get 5% increases over the same period.The workers want Sibanye to match a wage deal signed with Harmony Gold Ltd, which agreed to a R1,000 increase for each of the three years covered by the agreement.Sibanye says this wage increase is unsustainable for its gold operations and would increase its wage bill by R2.5bn in total by July 2023.
