Our new Mpact Versapak website places the emphasis on educating rather than just communicating, to put you at the forefront of the packaging industry! By downloading our brand-new, free e-book, you will understand the five top packaging truths: focusing on your value chain, EPR compliance, design for recyclability, how to produce packaging that is fit for purpose, and knowing when to ‘bin’ and when to ‘ban’. With access to our research team and well-respected design department, the Mpact Versapak team’s innovative approach to packaging surpasses many. Having garnered several awards in some of South Africa’s most prestigious ceremonies in 2021, we bring the circular economy to life!
