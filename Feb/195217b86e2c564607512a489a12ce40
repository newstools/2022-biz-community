The migration of traditional IT infrastructure enables the airline to run key workloads that include important financial data, secure customer records, aeroplane navigation information, and more—all on the cleanest cloud in the industry.Niral Patel, director of Google Cloud Africa, says: "With the customer positioned at the heart of everything the team does at Comair, we are proud to deliver the cloud infrastructure capabilities and tools that will further engrain the airline’s brand promise to be the easiest to book and pay. Comair’s digital transformation journey started before the pandemic and was indeed accelerated by it, but the airline had taken a head start to digitisation before the global lockdown was even in sight by migrating to the cloud. Also, by accelerating cloud adoption, Comair is able to reduce processing power for its systems and become more sustainable."Avsharn Bachoo, chief information officer of Comair adds: "We are delighted to have moved to Google Cloud at a time when Cloud has become the foundation that enables businesses to transform, differentiate and gain competitive advantage. The sooner you digitally transform, the quicker you’re able to respond to uncertain times.  As a result, the digital maturity measures we’ve put in place have helped drive a post-lockdown recovery."Comair has also been able to benefit from the security, reliability, and flexibility provided by Google Cloud, which has helped increase the airline’s efficiency during high-traffic seasons and peak travel times, as it needed to scale to meet consumer travel demand, and will now be able to analyse customer data in a deeper manner, creating personalised products and services, opening up more opportunities and improving the customer experience.
