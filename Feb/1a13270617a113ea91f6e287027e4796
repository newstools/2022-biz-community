With this programme we aim to empower them and ensure that the gardens are supported during each of the stages of growth,” said Sanjeev Raghubir, sustainability manager at the Shoprite Group. “Communities are struggling due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change, and this programme will provide much needed relief.”  Supporting food gardens is one of the many ways in which the Group ensures food security in under-resourced and vulnerable communities across South Africa. It supports more than 150 food gardens and over 2,500 home gardens - which impacts almost 17,000 beneficiaries - and in the past year trained more than 570 community members in sustainable food gardening.
