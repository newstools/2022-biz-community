But if you’re feeling a little less devotional and rather more destructive, then you’ve got to get yourself down to the Mall of Africa on Sunday, 13 February 2022 from 10am for Teljoy’s Break-up Bash!  A break up bash for Valentine’s Day, you ask? Yes! This year the country’s foremost home appliance rent-to-own provider is saying no to candles and cuddly toys and inviting you instead to pick up a hammer and smash their irreparable appliances to smithereens.  Rest assured that this destruction will take place in a safe controlled environment and that no useable appliances will be damaged in the process. So how it works is that participants will be kitted out in full safety gear – goggles, helmet, gloves, the works – before stepping into an enclosed perspex octagon in which they are welcome to beat old appliances to bits. Naturally you’ll be thinking of your ex as you bring the hammer down on an old washing machine! The lovely side to this “revenge” is that Teljoy will be donating brand new appliances to charity to offset the destruction, including Sungardens Hospice, Reach for a Dream and Frida Hartley Women’s Shelter. All waste from the destroyed units will be responsibly disposed of, and recycled where appropriate.  What’s more, there will be plenty of giveaways on the day, so love might just come to you in the form of a brand new TV this year! How to join the fun:Get yourself to the Mall of Africa on Sunday, 13 February between 10am and 7pm. The Break up Bash Octagon can be found between the kiddies play area and the outside restaurants. Also keep an eye on Teljoy’s social media channels for a sneak peek at the prizes to be won.
