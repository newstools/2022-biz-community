This includes travel rules by destination, country visa requirements, testing requirements and quarantine mandates. Using the Covid Trip Planner, travellers will better understand how they can plan travel based on the passport they hold and their COVID-19 vaccination status. They will also have direct access to any necessary forms to complete prior to departure.Laurent Fourier, CEO Assistance Services, International SOS says: "Omicron sparked another wave of travel bans and we expect travel regulations to continuously evolve, and the impact of Covid-19 may even transform the way we travel for many years to come. Each trip may require a risk management process based on the destination, need for travel, as well as additional Covid-19 restrictions."The launch of the Covid Trip Planner promotes a safe and sustainable return to travel for many organisations as they navigate the complexity of complying with the changing regulations and ensuring safe business travel decisions are made. Users of the Covid Trip Planner will also have access to the International SOS Assistance Centre 24/7 Support, enabling them to connect with medical or security professionals whenever needed.
