Social restrictions have been hampering especially when a huge part of our business involves networking with talent and creating relationships on a social level as well as on a professional level.

We really are investing in the future of influencer marketing… especially when it gets into the metaverse ;) Influencer marketing: Can we do more to keep the industry clean?By Tami Ruschin 17 Feb 2022.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Influencer marketing is such a huge thing right now. What are some of the trends we can see happening in this space?Influencer marketing is fast becoming a staple in brand marketing strategies and rollouts for 2022 with TikTok and Instagram being breeding grounds for most of the talent we work with. Obviously, if we’re talking specifics in SA, the Amapiano trend is the hottest genre blowing up at the moment with new tracks and challenges emerging almost every week on social media. The genre itself is completely viral and is definitely one of the trends to look out for in 2022. Augmented Reality is also fast becoming consumers' preferred way to try-on products and interact with brands. Worldwide, TikTok will dominate the social media space for 2022 and will gain the biggest share of the influencer marketing 'pie' as the platform generates the most engagement out of all social media networks. Another thing to look out for is influencer-led e-commerce stores where influencers with large followings are now opening up their own e-commerce stores and platforms such as Instagram and Facebook, that have made in-app purchasing easier for the consumer and audiences. Other massive trends include the NFT market with influencers creating their own NFT collections and podcasts which audiences find more engaging as they are unfiltered and uncensored. Also, big hype around virtual reality and the metaverse — it’s the future! NFT marketing with Dr Raeesah ChohanBy Emily Stander 10 Feb 2022.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}	How does it work? Do brands approach influences, or do influences approach brands?Mainly brands approach us, as an agency, to create and carve an online footprint for them, building a marketing strategy that involves our expertise of onboarding the right influencer with the right brand, getting the right fit is essential to success. Obviously, sometimes brands approach us wanting a certain influencer that they feel will represent their brand in a way they envisage and can relate to. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What is the process of assigning an influencer to a brand?When an influencer puts their name to a brand it’s essential that they feel comfortable endorsing it and it must be believable that they would actually utilise the product.  It is imperative that the entire process from start to finish looks as organic as possible. This is one of the main key elements of influencer marketing, the campaign needs to look as non-contrived as possible so that consumers and audiences can actually buy into what is being advertised. People will always follow like-minded people so a mismatch on a product or a brand can be quite disastrous. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Consumers want to see authentic influencers. Are brands still using influencers just because of their following or do they align with the brand values?Like I said previously a mismatch between a brand and an influencer can become a futile exercise. If the influencer's followers cannot relate to the brand being promoted then the whole process will be a bust. It has to be believable for a campaign to be successful. Influencers know that when they are putting their name to something there is a chance it can affect them negatively and they’re wise to that, that’s why influencers rely on us as an agency to align them with the right brand and product. In this instant digital media age, one false move can end careers as has been seen many times. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What happens when the brand decides to use an influencer but then doesn’t see any ROI?Like with all businesses there are risks and desired results are not always achieved, no one wants disappointment. Obviously, we would sit down with the client and the influencer and review the reasons behind the negative ROI and try to rectify the problem with the right solution either with a campaign adjustment or take it back to the drawing board. This is why it’s essential to align the right brand with the right influencer. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}When it comes to the metaverse, will social media still have a big impact?Of course, the metaverse will just take social media to the next level as an even more interactive version. The biggest social media platforms in the world, Facebook and Instagram have rebranded as “Meta” - to help build the metaverse: a place where one can connect in 3D augmented reality, it is the next evolution of social connection. The metaverse spaces will allow you to socialise, learn, trade and collaborate in ways that go beyond what anyone can imagine. Retail and the metaverse: A new world of consumer connection9 Feb 2022Essentially, as an influencer or agency in the metaverse, you can render your services to pretty much anyone throughout the globe without fear of censorship and decentralisation. The metaverse actually creates creator equity as there are no guidelines and limitations or overarching authority telling you what you can and can’t post. This can give agencies and influencers access to a global landscape where opportunity is endless with the shift to virtual augmented reality. Connection is evolving, if you look where we were 20 years ago from where we are now — imagine the next 20 years? It's definitely the next step in the internet revolution and Good Vibes is passionate about pushing the concept to as many brands, clients and friends as possible.
