Sepcol is the technical operator of the block though the production licence was held by consortium member Express Petroleum.Sepcol, which is in receivership, did not respond to requests for comment about how much crude Trinity Spirit was storing at the time of the blast.BP's Deepwater Horizon oil rig was pumping tens of thousands of barrels a day when it exploded in 2010. By the time the well was plugged 87 days later, 4 million barrels of crude had flowed into the Gulf of Mexico causing an environmental disaster."We got information of the fire incident yesterday and we immediately ordered our field officers to commence investigation. Investigations are still ongoing," Gbenga Komolafe, NUPRC's chief executive, told Reuters."It is only after when we have received the report of this investigation from our team that we will issue a comprehensive statement devoid of speculation," he said.Investigations underwaySepcol's Okafor said investigations were underway to establish the cause of the explosion while attempts to contain the situation were being made with help from local communities and US oil firm Chevron, which has a facility nearby.The Trinity Spirit is the primary production facility for OML 108 which covers 750km2 of water off the Niger Delta, ranging from a depth of 30 metres to 213 metres, Sepcol's website said.
