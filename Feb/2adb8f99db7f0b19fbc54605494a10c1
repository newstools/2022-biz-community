Therefore, corporate and investment sector participation is critical.“If we are serious about addressing the challenge of climate change, we must continue to engage the corporate and investor sectors in our efforts to influence the redirection of financial flows as a powerful lever to release money for sustainable investments. At the same time, we should withdraw the resources that underpin environmentally, socially or economically harmful impacts.”Currently, South Africa’s Presidential Climate Change Commission is undertaking extensive stakeholder and community engagement on this critical topic in recognition of the fact that climate risk is not only an environmental issue but also a direct economic and social issue with implications for the future competitiveness of the country and the livelihoods of its people.Former Absa chief executive to head Presidential Climate Finance Task Team1 day agoIdentifying vulnerabilitiesIn the 2021 edition of the Trialogue Business in Society Handbook, a publication produced annually by responsible business consultancy Trialogue, Smith advises directors and business leaders to understand that Scope 1 and 2 emissions are unlikely to be the only source of their climate risk. They should look up and down their value chains to identify vulnerabilities as well as opportunities for growth.The World Economic Forum (WEF) Global Risk report published early in January 2022 continues to highlight how central environmental and social risks are to the stability and future of the global economy. Over the 5-10-year horizon, the top five risks are all environmental in nature, including climate action failure, extreme weather events and biodiversity loss. Trialogue manager Matthew le Cordeur says that “directors need to factor climate change into their deliberations about strategy, risk management, and opportunities as part of their duty of care. Both the Companies Act and King IV create a basis for the expectation that directors should have the necessary skill and experience to perform their duties, and that this should extend to a broad range of matters that could significantly affect an organisation’s ability to create value”. 60% of South Africans optimistic that a climate disaster can be averted, research shows27 Jan 2022Implications for boardsLe Cordeur explains that this has two implications for boards. Firstly, all directors should have a foundational understanding of climate change and other key environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues. Secondly, given the complexity associated with climate and biodiversity issues, and growing expectations around disclosure, appropriate risk management and engagement with stakeholders, directors with specific experience should be recruited or developed. This is especially true for those directors serving on board committees with delegated responsibility for climate and other ESG issues.“Very little director training on climate and ESG issues seems to be available in South Africa, and more effort will need to be made by the Institute of Directors and similar organisations to close this gap. This will ensure that more directors are able to engage with investors on ESG issues in a competent manner, play the necessary internal oversight role, ensure the alignment of executive compensation with ESG performance and the identification, assessment, mitigation, and disclosure of climate and other ESG risks.”“Instead of simply reacting to the uncertainty of climate change impacts, companies should track new risks affecting their industry, shape the correct strategic response, and strengthen their agility and resilience to build an uncertainty advantage,” concludes Le Cordeur.
