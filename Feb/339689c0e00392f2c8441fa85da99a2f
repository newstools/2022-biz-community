The Hugo brand image has also had a new look since the last logo adjustment in the early 1990s. Both logos were redesigned to feature a more expressive graphic font, "for a more contemporary look and feel and a more memorable visual experience," the brand explained.With the more modern brand identity, which is part of the company's 'Claim 5' growth strategy, both Boss and Hugo are being aimed at a younger and more global target group.
