Cape Town Black Rhino GinThe Cape Town Gin & Spirits Company has added a new varietal to its lineup of gins, this time in aid of rhino conservation. Source: SuppliedThrough its new spirit, Cape Town Black Rhino Gin, the beverage company supports the ongoing fight to save the rhino by donating a portion of proceeds for every bottle sold to the Boucher Legacy, an NPO working to protect not only the endangered rhino but other dwindling species from extinction at the hands of humans with the hope of ending poaching for good across SA.Cape Town Black Rhino Gin is made in the classic style and infused with rhino bush and buchu. With its olive-green colour, which it gets from the local botanicals, and a slightly sweeter taste, the new gin is ideal for a new-style G&T. This is not the Cape Town Gin & Spirits Company's first product for a cause. Its The Pink Lady Gin supports the important work done by breast cancer community carer PinkDrive, and for its Rooibos Red Gin, the company works closely with Khoisan Gourmet, which empowers local Khoi and San farming communities.Cape Town Black Rhino Gin is available at all leading liquor outlets.Okja Chocolate Hazelnut SpreadOkja, the clean label plant-based food and beverage brand from Cape Town, best known for its strikingly packaged plant milks, has launched a Chocolate Hazelnut Spread.Source: SuppliedRecognising that many of the common chocolate-hazelnut spreads on shelves can contain more palm oil in them than hazelnuts, Okja's version contains none of this controversial ingredient, and also has no dairy or flavourings.The spread can be smeared on one's favourite bread or breakfast pastry, or simply scooped out of the jar by the spoonful for an indulgent treat.Okja Chocolate Hazelnut Spread is available from Takealot, selected Spar stores, Faithful to Nature, as well as popular delis such as Giovannis.
