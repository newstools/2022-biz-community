Deal set to bring new opportunities to the industryThe past two years were extremely difficult for the event industry, and companies such as DKSS faced numerous challenges in an environment that was essentially shut down. Despite their difficulties, the company is now upbeat and focused on the real potential that live, hybrid, digitally broadcast and streamed events present for the future.  With this partnership, the company will now be able to further pivot and leverage off of their digital production services as the live events industry opens up again. It currently offers streaming and hybrid event solutions for events as diverse as AGMs to golf days. DKSS founder CJ de Klerk says “this deal will bring new opportunities and advantages to the multimedia space” and “set the new standard in a very competitive market”.
