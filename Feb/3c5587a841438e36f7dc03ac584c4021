Listeners were given the opportunity to enter and as a result, 10 local, aspiring chefs were each awarded a R30,000 bursary with which to start their culinary journey at IHS in March this year.  The winners were also given the opportunity to secure further funding towards their fees by participating in a hotly contested cook-off this past Saturday. Lusanda Mafanya, a passionate cook who is ‘in-between jobs’, walked away victorious with a whopping R100,000 bursary, courtesy of IHS, to pursue his culinary dream.The initial March intake will be enrolments for the one-year professional cookery and two-year professional cookery and patisserie programmes.  Going forward, in addition to the culinary programmes, International Hotel School will be offering the full complement of degrees, diplomas and higher certificates in hospitality management.
