For this edition, the Festival will select some winners by lottery, so they can live the face-to-face experience in Dubai. Selected guests will have airfare, accommodation, access to the awards ceremony, VIP dinner and a cocktail party for the winners. The ceremony for this edition will be an exclusive meeting for VIP guests, local authorities, press and Wina winners. Registration will remain free and there will be improvements to the system for the winnersChangesAs of this edition of the Wina Festival, the winners' system will have a change that will optimize participants’ investment. Previously, winners paid award rights without knowing if they got gold, silver, bronze or honourable mention; but as of the 2022 edition, the winners will pay award fees only for the trophies, since from now the honourable mentions will only be for finalists. The payment for honourable mentions will be lower than that for trophy rights, and the winner will also have the option to accept it or not. It should be remembered that the festival does not charge for cases to be registered; in Wina only the winners pay award fees and this single payment already includes the trophy, its shipment and the international customs of the courier.Another novelty for this year, is that the festival decided to lower the registration limit for additional cases and also reduced the amount of free registration of cases per agency to four. With this, the festival seeks that the ranking does not depend on who has the largest budget to invest in registering cases, but rather the one with the best evaluations of their ideas. In this way, it will be possible to make the final ranking with fewer numbers of winning pieces.New look trophyThe redesign of the trophy is another important development, since it will have new and better materials, finishes with greater detail and a glass base with laser engraving, making it even more appealing to obtain one of the Wina trophies.The organisation confirms that there will be 108 judges from traditional and independent multinational agencies from the five continents, which will be judging the 18 festival categories. It should be noted that the methodology used in assigning categories to jurors, which will take place one day before the evaluation, ensures jurors who also participate with their agencies do not have to judge categories where they have pieces registered.The last date for case registration is 26 April and the award ceremony will take place on 10 June 2022.For more, go to https://winafestival.com/
