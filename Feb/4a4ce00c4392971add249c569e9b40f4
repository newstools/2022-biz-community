Their inclusion grows the awards, which recognise global packaging design excellence, in the beauty, luxury fragrances and household goods sectors as well as beverages and food. “I cannot wait to get started on this year’s judging, this year’s panel is absolutely stellar! We continue to evolve, to learn new ways to work together, as Daft Punk would say "harder, better, faster, stronger,” says Clem Halpin, president of the Pentawards jury and design lead at Taxi Studio added.This year’s jury also includes 17 female judges - an increase of five from the 2021 panel.“As a panel we are more inclusive, more diverse, more reflective of the global nature of the Pentawards than ever,” says Halpin. Sustainable packagingThis year’s expanded jury also reflects Pentawards’ ongoing commitment to championing sustainable packaging with sustainability experts from WWF and Beiersdorf joining the Pentawards Sustainable Design Jury, which launched last year to recognise the progress being made by brands, manufacturers and designers across the globe in the sustainable packaging area.“The Pentawards is a crucial platform for raising awareness of the importance of design excellence in our modern society and I’m grateful for the opportunity to join the jury,” says Paula Chin, sustainable materials specialist at WWF.“We’re facing ever-increasing global challenges - not least the triple crisis of climate change, biodiversity and nature loss, and pollution and waste – so the creation of a Sustainable Design category is extremely welcome. “Over 80% of a product’s environmental impact is determined at the design stage so this community has a vital role to play in tackling these challenges and delivering better outcomes for people and the planet,” she adds. 2022 Pentawards JuryClem Halpin – President Pentawards Jury,design lead, Taxi Studio - UKPhilip Neufeldt –– creative director, Estée Lauder – FranceWendy Annonay –senior director, packaging design & development, Huda Beauty – UAEDavid Gadd –– global design directory, Mars Food – UKMarta Suslow –– sustainable innovation & transformation, Beiersdorf – GermanyCaitlin Field – associate creative director, Amazon Kitchen Creative, Amazon – USPaula Chin – sustainable materials specialist, WWF – UKJennie Potts – design director, B&B Studio –– UKAndy Liu –– founder & chief creative officer, Shenzhen Oracle Design – ChinaEisuke Tachikawa –– CEO of Nosigner & JIDA president, Nosigner – JapanLuke Li – creative lead / art director, IKEA – SwedenNeha Tulsian –founder & creative director, NH1 Design – IndiaGaël Le Bourges –R&D packaging senior director, Fragrances and Luxury Cosmetics, Coty - FranceHernán Braberman – executive design director, Tridimage – ArgentinaEvelio Mattos – founder / host, Package Design Unboxd – USPaul Roeters – creative director, Studio Kluif – NetherlandsPaco Adin – creative director, Supperstudio – SpainStepan Azaryan – creative director, Backbone Branding – ArmeniaPavla Chuykina – graphic designer, Pavla.design – RussiaCamille de Dominicis – – co-founder, brand director, Eminente by Moët Hennessy – FranceXiongBo Deng – creative director, ShenZhen Lingyun Creative Packaging Design Co.
