As a result, we will need to close the N1 Southbound between the Flying Saucer Interchange and Botha Avenue on N1/R21 from 11pm on Sunday, 6 February 2022 until 4am on Monday, 7 February 2022. Only one lane will be open during this period," said Hlahla.The closure is required for gravity survey testing taking place in the fast lanes of the southbound carriageway as part of the geotechnical investigations required for the remediation works on the sinkhole.The duration of the closure will be kept as short as possible to avoid any further disruptions.Motorist travelling southwards towards Johannesburg may consider using the following alternative routes:• From Polokwane, offramp at Proefplaas Interchange (145) towards Pretoria CBD using the N4/M2 and join the M3 towards Fountains and join the N14.From OR Tambo International airport, continue on the R21 towards Fountain circle and join the N14"Motorists are requested to plan their trips accordingly, consider alternative routes and use caution when making use of the roads," said Hlahla.Sanral apologises for any inconvenience caused.
