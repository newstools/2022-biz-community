This is the first release from the legendary musician since his passing three years ago. The song has the soul of Tuku and one can feel the labour of love that was poured into the song by both Mbeu and Dr Oliver Mtukudzi. My Better Half is from Tuku’s upcoming body of work titled, Abiangu 2 which means “friends” in Shona (Chikorekore dialect), the follow up to Abiangu (Duets Of My Time) released in 2011.  The duet is a ballad that celebrates finding “the one”, which is fitting as we’re nearing Valentine’s Day, in the month of love.
