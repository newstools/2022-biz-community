Investments in electric vehicles and hydrogen will equip South Africa to meet the global clean energy future,” he said.Ramaphosa added that with South Africa’s rich mineral resources, mining is also expected to benefit from a move towards cleaner energy.“We will be able to expand our mining industry in strategic minerals that are crucial for clean energy, like platinum, vanadium, cobalt, copper, manganese and lithium. We also have a unique opportunity in green hydrogen, given our world-class solar and wind resources and local technology and expertise,” he said.
