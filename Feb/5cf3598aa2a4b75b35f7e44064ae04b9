The only way for us to provide reliable and affordable electricity to our residents is to source it from elsewhere," said Hill-Lewis, in a statement released earlier this month.BREAKING: Cape Town mayor announces they have opened a procurement process for IPPs to generate up to 300 MW of energy, most being in solar power.

The economic effects of a reliable power supply in Cape Town will mean more profitable businesses and more job opportunities," he said.Over the coming months, the City of Cape Town will procure up to 300MW of renewable energy. The tender documents are now available on the city's website, Hill-Lewis said at the conference."The city will be considering proposals from IPPs for projects between 5­–20MW that will allow us to access an affordable and reliable electricity supply, especially those that are able to help us reduce our reliance on Eskom during peak times of use. We will consider proposals from a range of projects, including generation-only projects, generation-plus-storage projects, and storage-only projects," he said.
