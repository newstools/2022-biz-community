It’s always a tricky ask of a creative brief to dramatically shift a brand into a space that is both modern and trendy, as well as being reflective of African roots and heritage. It’s almost paradoxical. But get it right, and you are able to access the elusive South African millennial consumer that demands authenticity, accessibility and the opportunity to define and personalise brands in their own way.Status had become stale and irrelevant with their consumer set. The only way to gain market share and growth was through a significant change in visual identity and target audience. Appealing to a younger and more affluent audience brings the brand into position to finally realise its goal of becoming the market leader in the cologne-deodorant sub-category.New look Status is defiant – throwing out all expected category cues – and displaying powerful African inspired patterns from top to bottom. Each one unique to each scent. The architecture and jargon on the pack itself emulate the cologne/perfume industry – allowing Status to truly own fragrance as a key differentiator. Status isn’t playing it safe. A Status man isn’t fooled by brands that serve up passé creative or global brand-replicas. They take pride in their African status and will define things their own way. Bold. African. Creative. And Real.Want to read about insights, trends and other cool stuff? Sign up to our mailing list.
