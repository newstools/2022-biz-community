As part of our mission to turn 2022 into #Twenty20You, OFM wants our listeners to be part of our special road trip album! Not only are we creating a digital memory of our cherished listeners to publish online, we plan to place this giant montage on the highways crisscrossing Central South Africa and let your friendly faces welcome visitors to OFM airspace. To be part of our giant memory wall, fans need to visit any OFM outside broadcast from 3 March to 26 June 2022, have the OFM team snap your pic in the designated area, and let them capture your details to be entered into the grand prize draw for R20,000 cash on OFM’s birthday – 1 July 2022. Plus, to start the celebrations early, OFM will be awarding spot prizes of R1,000 per every “All O- ver Central SA” outside broadcast! The first 100 visitors at each of our “All O-ver Central SA” outside broadcasts will also receive an exclusive wristband. “This campaign also ties in to The Real Good Travel Book competition, we recently launched with Hinterland and Hinterland Fuels. Our presenters are eager to ‘hit the road’ and explore the beautiful places and meet the lovely faces of Central South Africa. It’s a wonderful way of bringing the voices on air, closer to the ears on the ground,” says OFM content manager, Elzette Boucher-Krüger. For more information, contact az.oc.mfo@gnitekram.
