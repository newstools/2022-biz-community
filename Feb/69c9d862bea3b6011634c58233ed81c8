Additionally, the publisher will be using the recently launched Publisher Inventory Compatibility Score to enable them to better understand how their content is perceived by advertisers. This will result in “high quality” media offerings that Media24 can sell at a higher rate compared to selling across an entire network of inventory. Unique challenges“What set DoubleVerify apart for us was the company’s expertise - the team understands our unique challenges and can provide prescriptive advice to help us meet our goals,” says Michael Allen, head of Ad Tech at Media24. “Furthermore, the ability to gain clarity into how our inventory is perceived by digital buyers is absolutely key for us, so that we can continue to provide the highest standard of viewability and brand safety that they have come to expect from us.” This partnership builds on DoubleVerify’s Publisher Division, which guides publishers on how they can combine data automation, campaign performance, media quality insights and delivery optimization into one place. DoubleVerify’s solutions help the publisher community improve transparency, increase efficiency and maximise inventory monetization opportunities. “While publishers are coming to us to access our innovative solutions, the global team that is behind the scenes across our insights, R&D and engineering teams guides publishers on how best to leverage our offerings and represents the heart of our solutionset,” says Mimi Wotring, SVP of publisher sales & client services at DoubleVerify. “We are excited to help Media24 gain a competitive edge through the use of our yield insights, automation, and years of expertise in the publisher space.”
