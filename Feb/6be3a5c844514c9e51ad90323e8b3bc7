We look at DMT from an organisational maturity point of view with the understanding that success cannot be achieved if the organisation is not prepared to evolve. MultiChoice started its digital maturity journey 18 months ago with the aim to consolidate, drive efficiencies, get closer to partners, get better at measurement and reporting and have positive ROI.
