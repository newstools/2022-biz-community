The breadth of the agency’s scope includes BMW, Mini, Customer Support and Financial Services.“Being the incumbent agency can be challenging in a pitch, but the fact that we prevailed indicates the strength of the current relationship, the work we have done over the last three years, and the quality of the pitch we put together. We were up against some of the very best creative agencies in the country. So we’re incredibly proud to see that our commitment to building creative and strategic excellence has played to our advantage,” expressed Michael Oelschig, Wunderman Thompson managing director. According to Thilosh Moodally, general manager, Customer, Brand and Channel Development at The BMW Group: “The Wunderman Thompson team understands our brands and responded to our brief perfectly. They presented strong strategies that flowed into creative work that are rooted in real cultural insight of our South African consumers. We are so excited to embark on this next phase of our partnership.”Oelschig added, “The brief was more than a campaign – it was a five to ten-year vision that we had to solve. So being awarded this pitch reinforces how aligned we are with their business and how we can set a vision into the future beyond a one-off campaign. We are honoured to continue to partner with such iconic brands.”
