The introduction of this advanced technology is a first for both patient care and surgical innovation in the South African State health system.Two da Vinci Xi systems  - the fourth generation and most technologically advanced surgical robot currently available - were acquired by Western Cape Government in October 2021. The Tygerberg Hospital system will be used by surgeons from the specialist disciplines of colorectal surgery, urology, gynaecology, and hepatobiliary surgery. The system’s versatility and its use by multiple surgical specialities will maximise the number of patients who will benefit from this sophisticated medical technology. The main diseases that the programme will focus on are colorectal, liver, prostate, kidney and bladder cancers, and women with severe endometriosis."Yet again, the Provincial Department of Health is putting the Western Cape Government’s core value of innovation into practice. It truly is an incredible feat that Tygerberg Hospital has become the first public hospital in South Africa to perform a robotic surgical procedure today," said Premier Alan Winde. "It is going to make a big difference in helping us recover our comprehensive healthcare services, which were impacted by the pandemic. I applaud all those involved in this significant achievement for the Western Cape."
