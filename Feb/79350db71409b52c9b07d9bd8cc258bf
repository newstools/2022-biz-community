The black-empowered mining and energy solutions company listed on the JSE and member of the JSE Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) Index is headquartered in Pretoria.It prides itself in being more than just an industrial business and is driven by the belief that sustainability and empowering local communities, while making a positive impact on the world, is central to its purpose.Boomtown was tasked by Cennergi to create and implement a strategic approach for the relaunch of its renewable energy business, comprising Cennergi Holdings and Cennergi Services.Cennergi Holdings will now develop, own and operate a balanced portfolio of renewable energy assets in the distributed and utility segments in South Africa and select international markets, while Cennergi Services will provide full-scope management services to projects in the renewable energy sector through value-added services and digital solutions.“Our role was to craft and develop a brand strategy that would redefine Cennergi’s new roles, create and design their new visual identities, and put together an effective launch strategy for both entities,” said Boomtown business and strategy director, Stuart Innell.“Our key objective was to deliver a strong, recognisable brand and distinguishable corporate image that positions Cennergi Holdings and Cennergi Services in their new roles of providing agility and sustainable value creation in a low carbon world and, very importantly, would stand out among its peers.“The agency’s solution was three-phased. Phase 1 involved coming to grips with both brands and their offerings to ensure effective linkages between them and their stakeholders within the brand strategy while staying in line with the overall Exxaro vision.“Phase 2 involved hands-on collaboration with the client to develop the visual and corporate identity designs. We believe the logo is distinctive but still showcases the link between the two companies. Phase 3 addressed a new website and launching the companies to its key target audiences,” he said.
