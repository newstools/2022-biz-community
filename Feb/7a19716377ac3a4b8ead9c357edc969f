That’s it, that’s the message every day,” he says. Inspirational stories and good newsThe Good Things Guy will also be featured in the Innovate South Africa book later this year.

Is there a space for good news – and do South Africans have an appetite for it?“Brent Lindeque founded the Good Things Guy on 1 August 2015 to change the national conversation to bring a balanced view and perception of South Africa for South Africans through inspirational stories and good news,” it states. “South Africans have proven their appetite for good news and inspirational stories with their support of the Good Things Guy. Lindeque has also created a team of journalists and storytellers to help him craft and shape their message of positivity and kindness to the world,” it adds.
