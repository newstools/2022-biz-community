Thank you for your passion and great influence on vernecular language broadcasting. #RIPDumileMateza pic.twitter.com/WUIdnU6SRT— Khanyi Magubane (@Khanyi_Magubane) February 1, 2022Mateza was born in Kareedouw, Eastern Cape, and was a former schoolteacher. In the early 1980s, he gained popularity as a sports commentator at SABC. Renowned for his versatility, he was able to comment in English, isiXhosa, and Afrikaans. Oh my word this is so sad #RIPDumileMateza pic.twitter.com/z7CBAQOTGY— Ashraf Garda (@AshrafGarda) February 1, 2022Mateza will be remembered for his giant contribution to the industry, and for covering events like the 1995 Rugby World Cup - which he did in Afrikaans, as the Springboks beat the All Blacks 15-12 at Ellis Park. A former Boxing South Africa board member and a major name in the broadcasting industry, he will be missed by fans and those who had the privilege of working with him.Very few people are as honest as he was about their views on everything. He didn't care if his views were not popular. Dumile Mateza would share them when we met on the corridors & in public and was quick to say "nonsense, Zondi" when he disagreed. Man! #RIPDumileMateza pic.twitter.com/M5u3NS9kUj— Siphumelele Zondi (@SZondi) February 1, 2022
