The report, that ranks the most creative campaigns, brands and agencies by business sector, sees Burger King as a top performer in both the Retail and Food categories, with the continuing success of the “Moldy Whopper” and several new campaigns. These come from a variety of agencies, confirming once again that an advertiser with a taste for creativity drives award-winning work. Another multiple award-winner, Mastercard, in the Finance category, saw its ground-breaking “True Name” initiative from McCann New York resonated with juries worldwide. The most awarded work tends to shatter conventions and “Wombstories” for Bodyform from AMV BBDO in Health & Beauty, and the “Stay Home Miles Exchange” from Thai Airways and Wunderman Thompson in Transport & Tourism (which rewarded customers for going precisely nowhere) did exactly that. But there is still room for a beautifully made film, such as Burberry’s “Festive” by Riff Raff Films, which tops the Luxury ranking.
