In today’s competitive beer scene, it has become more important than ever for brands to remain relevant and to stay fresh. With this in mind, Castle Lite conducted pack research to test its secondary packaging with consumers in 2021. Findings from the research indicated that consumers require products that are very easy to spot within a much-cluttered market so that they can have a seamless shopping experience. “Castle Lite is a brand that puts premium enjoyment front and centre. We have maintained our position over the years as an accessible premium brand with a distinctive positioning and visual identity. With the packaging refresh, it was critical that the brand maintains its premium look which speaks to our high-quality taste while giving us a more appealing canvas to connect with our consumers. We are excited to introduce our fresh new look with the same refreshing taste that consumers have come to love and enjoy over the years,” says Castle Lite brand director, Colleen Duvenage. The new look boasts an updated colour scheme with blue and grey blends making the packing more appealing and attractive. When researched amongst consumers, they noted that the new colours cue cold, premium and refreshing. The brand has taken a completely different direction with this refresh, with a pack that reflects what’s inside: superior, high-quality refreshment. Consumers need not worry, the only thing that has changed is the packaging, the liquid is still the same extra cold, premium and refreshing Castle Lite consumers know and love.
