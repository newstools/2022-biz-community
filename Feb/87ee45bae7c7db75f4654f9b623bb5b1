To my knowledge, no," he said of the comparatively less expensive loan that also afforded South Africa a repayment holiday for the first three years.SA's debt-to-GDP ratio at historical highGodongwana said unless South Africa, whose debt-to-GDP ratio is hovering around a historically high 80% - managed to urgently solve its debt malaise - the country could struggle to meet its repayment obligations in future."Are we likely to meet our obligations? The answer is yes and no. Yes, for now, that is what we are going to be telling you on the 23rd, but ... if we don't change the debt trajectory, we may not be able to solve those obligations," Godongwana said.Godongwana presents his maiden national budget to parliament on February 23.
