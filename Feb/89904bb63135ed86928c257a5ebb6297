Movies and music come together at Sound On Screen - since 2010 Flamedrop Productions has been curating an eclectic array of music-related movies, documentaries and subjects linked to music and sound in all of its forms from around the globe. This edition includes movies from across Africa, Europe, Asia, North America, UK and beyond.Sound on Screen will take place from 25 February to 6 March 2022.  Traditionally a cinema-based indie festival, the 2022 edition of Sound On Screen will be its first on-line virtual event. The main advantage of this is that viewers across South Africa can access any of the movies across the festival period instead of being limited to a single screening in one particular city cinema.   From subdued, beautiful, lyrical musical sentiments all the way through to eruptions of audio genius, innovation, intensity, history and madness - and everything in between - you can expect genre variants from Pop, Rock, Hip-Hop, African, Classical, Metal and Punk, to Choral, Disco, Experimental, ‘80s Pop Legends, Electronic, Folk, Garage, Jazz and even something for vinyl collectors and horror fans! The exciting movies traverse moods across the spectrum, all illustrating the power of music: Serious, humorous, entertaining, enlightening, uplifting, heartbreaking, inspiring, hopeful, informative, social commentary, educational, touching on the pandemic and more. Where it has always mainly been a feature film-oriented event, this year a wider range of short subjects are also included (compiled into feature-length collections). A heavily discounted full festival pass gives the viewer access to everything at half the price (six movies/documentaries and six feature-length collections of 28 short- to medium length subjects): Single Movie Pass: R30Full Festival Pass: R150 To buy tickets, join on stream and see the full lineup, go here.
