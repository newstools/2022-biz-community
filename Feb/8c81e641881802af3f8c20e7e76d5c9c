Motherboard’s remit includes consumer brands Electrolux, AEG and Kwikot, and the work will encompass social media, community management, content development and digital strategy.Brave Group’s chief future officer Musa Kalenga says, “We are thrilled to welcome Electrolux South Africa to Motherboard. We are on a journey to service local and global brands by using bravery and foresight to move brands from good to great. Given the complex market challenges that we face, we are excited to partner with Electrolux South Africa to create relevance for their brands, using our digitally optimised services and creative suite of solutions.”Electrolux South Africa is part of the Swedish headquartered global appliance company that lives by the ethos: “Outstanding taste experiences should be easy for everyone and that the home should be a place for wellbeing and a place to care for ourselves and our loved ones.”Electrolux SA’s digital marketing manager, Steven Bosch, says digital platforms are increasingly forming a vital part in creating outstanding consumer experiences. “Consumers are at the heart of what we do and digital provides us as a company the opportunity to interact with our customers along the various parts of their purchasing and ownership journey. We see our digital channels as places where we can inspire, educate, and provide the information necessary for customers to make informed purchases. And, at the same time, we can also get quite a clear idea of what our customers like, and do not like, to improve what we do.”Bosch adds that he hopes Electrolux’s social media channels will become a place that surprises and delights the company’s communities with content that speaks their language. “Sustainability is a key transformation driver for us as Electrolux, so we’d also like to see our customers align with us in showing responsibility to the planet, our people and future generations.” Kalenga says, “Our job will be to enhance and amplify those meaningful ideals in the digital space to make sure that customers become an integral part of an exciting and constantly innovating brand journey.”
