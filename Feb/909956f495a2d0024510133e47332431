The new logo sees 'MTN' written in normal block letters and in blue with an oval of the same colour around it. The company's old tagline '“Everywhere you go' is now replaced with 'Yello' with the same style of writing as 'MTN'. The Yellow background seems to be a lighter shade of yellow than the older logo, but it cannot be 100% confirmed as of yet.Nompilo Morafo, MTN chief sustainability and corporate affairs officer, said the new look aligns with the group's evolution from a telecommunications company to a technology company.“Our commitment and focus to accelerate Africa’s progress sees MTN revealing a refreshed brand identity and campaign from 27 February,” said Morafo.The rebrand will be group-wide, and not just outside MTN’s Johannesburg headquarters, according to Mybroadband's report. The application to CIPC can be seen in a PDF document, confirming the upcoming rebrand.
