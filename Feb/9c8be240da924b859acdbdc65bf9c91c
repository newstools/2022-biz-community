Kimberly TaylorWe find out more from the brains behind the new 360 fulfilment platform for supply chain industries. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}When, how and why did you get started?I was doing a project at varsity in 2015 when the idea came to me. The project required me to write a route optimisation algorithm. I then wondered whether logistics companies were using route optimisation in order to be more efficient. After speaking to some companies I saw a gap in solving some real-world supply chain issues through technology.At the time, I was curious and I love solving problems. So after some research and understanding the problem, I wanted to build the technology that would help these companies..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What is the core function of Loop?We aim to help our clients, manage, optimise and scale their delivery business by managing their drivers and orders through visibility and communication.

Scaling from 30,000 deliveries to 300,000 deliveries at some point came with a lot of challenges – from a technical and cost perspective..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Have you received any funding to get Loop up and running? If so, what was the process like?Yes, I have. Pretty much the same process as trying to get a client. I spoke to lots of different people and businesses – showing them my idea, but instead of trying to get them to be a potential client – I was trying to convince them to see the potential growth of the business and provide me with capital to build the product. It was difficult as I had no track record or experience for them to base any decision around investing in me or my idea. However, if you want something enough you just keep asking until someone says yes..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What advice would you give to other aspiring entrepreneurs?Challenges in business are a lot easier to navigate and persevere through when you are doing something you are passionate about and have a clear vision on what you want to achieve. So have a strong why and passion for what you are doing Also, understand the problem you are solving, deeply! Speak to and experience the daily lives of the people who will use the tech. You are then more likely to be really entrenched in your users' lives and be able to monetise the technology. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Where would you like to see Loop in the next five years?Entrenched in the operations of businesses in many industries with a global presence.
