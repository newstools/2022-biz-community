Zucker was required to disclose when the relationship began, but he didn’t, and is resigning as a result. In a statement on 2 February, Gollust said that she will be remaining in her position at CNN. She continued to say, “Jeff and I have been close friends and professional partners for over 20 years. Recently, our relationship changed during Covid. I regret that we didn’t disclose it at the right time. I’m incredibly proud of my time at CNN and look forward to continuing the great work we do every day.”Jeff Zucker just announced his resignation to a stunned CNN. pic.twitter.com/sWXYNBO20d— Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) February 2, 2022WarnerMedia CEO, Jason Kilar, said in a statement, “We thank Jeff for his contributions over the past nine years.
