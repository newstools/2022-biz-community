Building on the success of its Schools Recycling Competition for the last few years around the country, Mpact Recycling honoured schools that have exhibited the greatest commitment to the initiative and increased their recycling figures significantly every year.Mpact Recycling communication manager, Donna-Mari Noble, says the competition, which runs every year, encourages nursery schools, primary schools and high schools in Gauteng (including Pretoria and Midrand), KwaZulu-Natal (including Richards Bay) and Western Cape to collect as much recyclables as possible. “The schools are paid per tonne collected, which they can use to fund various school initiatives such as creating vegetable gardens, painting classrooms or buying books,” indicates Yasmeen Adam, Post-Consumer Lead for the schools & communities programme.A notable success story is Maragon Private School in Pretoria that only joined the Ronnie Recycler Schools Programme in September 2021. They placed 1st in the schools competition (for the Pretoria region) having collected an admirable 9.195 tonnes.Another school that increased their collection rate significantly is Kenridge Primary School in the Western Cape. In 2020, the school recycled 5.325 tonnes but exceeded this figure in 2021 with an impressive 15.076 tonnes, which placed them 1st in the Western Cape region. They boosted their volume by over 9 tonnes.In Kwa-Zulu Natal, Chelsea Preparatory School recycled 3.555 tonnes in 2020 but exceeded this in 2021 with a remarkable 10.859 tonnes – placing them 1st in the Kwa-Zulu Natal region. The school increased their volume by over 7 tonnes.St. Martins Preparatory School in Johannesburg South recycled an impressive 10.879 tonnes, exceeding their 4.286 tonne figure from 2020 and placing them 1st in the Johannesburg South/West region. Their volume increased by over 6 tonnes.Veritas Junior College in Springs grew their tonnage from 1.69 tonnes in 2020 to 5.615 tonnes in 2021 – increasing their collection rate by over 3 tonnes and placing them 1st in the the Johannesburg North/East region.“These schools not only out-performed other schools in their districts, but increased their tonnage consistently over the years,” says Noble.Mpact Recycling congratulates all the schools that took part in the recycling programme across South Africa. “We would like to see more schools join the programme. Our 2022 schools recycling competition kicks off on the 1st February – but you have to be recycling with Mpact Recycling in order to win. To those who are already part of the programme, please continue to grow your tonnages and help make South Africa a cleaner and healthier place to live,” concludes Noble.The full list of results can be found HERE.Does your school want to get involved?
