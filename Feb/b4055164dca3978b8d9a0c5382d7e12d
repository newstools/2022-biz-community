The hugely successful inaugural Plant Powered Show (under the name The Festive Vegan & Plant Powered Show) took place online in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown restrictions and featured an extraordinary line-up of local and international chefs. Aimed at those looking to live and enjoy a healthier, more conscious and sustainable lifestyle with a smaller environmental footprint, The Plant Powered Show features professional chefs, celebrity cooks and rising stars presenting live cooking demos, diverse and compelling talks by the health and wellness experts, premium and interactive experiences, exclusive industry networking and a marketplace of plant-based food, drink and lifestyle products.#ConsciousLiving: How the Vegan and Plant-Powered Show is harnessing the new virtual event space - Q&A with Heidi WarrickerBy Ruth Cooper 10 Nov 2020Hybrid format will be a potent combinationEvent producer, Heidi Warricker, says: "We are delighted to finally be able to launch The Plant Powered Show as a live in-person event in Cape Town but also pleased that it will retain the online component. We believe that this ‘hybrid’ format will be a potent combination.Consumers want to live more consciously and be more mindful of the animals we share the planet with. At the same time, chefs and foodies want to be inspired to create delicious meals with exciting new ingredients.“After a postponement due to the pandemic, we are starting live this year in Cape Town,” says event producer, Heidi Warricker.New consultant and FoodForward SA partnershipAlso joining the team as a consultant is Emma-Claire Peter who started off her culinary career in food styling, recipe development and writing before working as a restaurant and chefs' theatre coordinator for Tastee festivals and then moving into food retail, working in Selfridges and Sourced Market in London.Peter, a trained chef, most recently produced Plant Forward Kitchen for Google Foods in partnership with the Culinary Institute of America, an experience that led to her adopting a vegan lifestyle.FoodForward SA expands to rural Emalahleni in Mpumalanga28 Jan 2022The Plant Powered Show has also announced FoodForward SA as its official CSI partner. FoodForward SA is the largest food redistribution organisation in South Africa. Established in 2009 to address widespread hunger in the country, FoodForward SA connects a world of excess to a world of need by recovering quality edible surplus food from the consumer goods supply chain and distributing it to community organisations that serve the poor.The partnership explainedWarricker explains why The Plant Powered Show selected FoodForward SA to be their official CSI Partner: “One-third of all food produced in South Africa is dumped in landfills, while millions of people are going hungry in our country, on a daily basis. As consumers we can’t only focus on what we eat and where our food comes from, we also need to look at food insecurity and what we can do to help alleviate this problem.” The plant-based food revolution is a fast-growing industry and an exciting space for new and emerging businesses and startups.#ThePlantPoweredShow, taking place live & online from 27-29 May at CTICC, Cape Town is offering all #smallbusinesses, #producers & #entrepreneurs a specially priced show package.
