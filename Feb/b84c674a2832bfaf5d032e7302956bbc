Image credit: Naresh MaharajWe are in the month of love, so it was planned by Renault that all journos drive red Clio V’s. And I must add that the drive was superb. As motoring scribes, we really do put the vehicles we drive through a plethora of tests. Happy to report that the Clio V ticked all the boxes. Renault has, despite the problems experienced with Covid related issues managed to hold their own together. Whilst most original equipment manufacturers all took massive sales hits, Renault was still able to post modest sales figures. The Kwid, Triber, Kiger, Duster and Koleos sold well.'Image credit: Naresh MaharajBack to the Clio V. The iconic Clio model is almost synonymous with the Renault brand itself. To think that the Renault CLIO celebrated its 30th-anniversary global in 2020 already. Since its first introduction, the Clio became Group Renault’s best seller throughout the world, with more than 15 million units sold globally.
