#LoveWhatYouDo castIt’s this commitment that has always drawn Sweet-Orr to trailblazers, creative thinkers, and hard workers in every field; and why they’ve chosen to celebrate them and the remarkable work they do. Launching the #LoveWhatYouDo campaign, Sweet-Orr has partnered with 10 South African industry leaders to showcase their talent and celebrate their inspiring stories. It’s a salute to the hardworking men and women from different industries, who all share one common trait: they have a deep-rooted love and passion for what they do. The #LoveWhatYouDo campaign will see each of these talented individuals tell their unique stories, and share what inspires and drives them, and where the love for their craft comes from. In this video series, we’ll get a first-hand glimpse into their world, and celebrate ordinary people doing extraordinary things.The video series will include: Otto Du Plessis (sculptor)David Southwood (photographer)Gino Lange (custom car fabricator)Hiram Koopman (saxophonist)Jo Neser Olive (farmer)Thandie Dowrey (jewellery designer)Leighton Rathbone (mixologist)Bongani Mnisi (head of conservation)Lyndi Sales (contemporary artist)Buddy Chellan (BMX athlete)“As one of the oldest global protective wear brands,” says executive director, Denver Berman-Jacob, “we don't only pride ourselves on the quality of our garments, but also on the small role we get to play in enabling individuals; artists, creators, makers, craftsmen and women, to what inspires them, the things that drive, the things that make the world a better place. We felt this campaign was important to not only celebrate the wearers of our garments but to be a voice of hope at a time when society can do with a positive message. And the message is clear, do what you love, love what you do.” Over the course of the next few months, this video series will tell untold stories, celebrate remarkable journeys, and inspire us all to find love in everything that we do.
