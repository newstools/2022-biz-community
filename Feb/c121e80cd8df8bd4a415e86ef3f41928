As people start to physically reconnect, many of these new forms of connection will remain in place, making people more connected than before.Social media platforms are perfectly positioned to spread joy, kindness, and positivity. Meta’s technologies have always been about connecting people. “Through the #KindActsBigImpact campaign, we want to inspire South Africans to use technologies like ours to foster community, spread kindness online and share their stories to encourage others to do the same,” says Itumeleng Morule, corporate communications associate manager, SADC at Meta. “Now more than ever, the world desperately needs more kindness. Whether it’s a heartfelt compliment on a friend’s Facebook or Instagram post or starting a WhatsApp health and wellness support group. We hope people feel inspired to be kind online and offline – not only on RAK Day, but every day,” adds Morule.  Making kindness the normStarted by non-profit organisation The Random Acts of Kindness Foundation, RAK Day inspires people to be kind to each other, simply for the sake of spreading kindness. The foundation’s mission is to make kindness the norm, investing resources into connecting individuals through kindness and teaching kindness in schools, workplaces, and homes around the world.Good Things Guy named one of the world's top 100 innovation success stories2 days agoWe don’t talk about fight clubBrent Lindeque, founder of GoodThingsGuy adds: "A day like today is so important, especially now. It serves as a reminder to just be kind.”  He adds that the last two years have been long, incredibly tough, and everyone’s pretty tired. “Plus we rarely open up about what we’re really going through. Everyone is fighting in a fight club you know nothing about... because we don’t talk about fight club.“And even though you cannot be responsible for someone else's feelings, perspective on life or self-esteem, do not contribute to their struggle.  “We rise by lifting others. And we do that with kindness, so I hope you use today to be kinder, love louder and share only good things.”  Submit your own #KindActsBigImpact story here and you could be featured on the GoodThingsGuy’s platforms.
