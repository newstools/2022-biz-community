Lockdown regulations and the ongoing threat of further waves of Covid-19 means face-to-face meetings are no longer a viable option either,” comments Plascon’s head of marketing, Suvasin Moodley.SA's e-tailers finally getting to grips with festive rush10 Feb 2022User experienceWith a simple-to-navigate user experience, the online platform allows users to sign in, search for their desired products, calculate costs, upload files and make orders.
