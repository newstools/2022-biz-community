It feels as if the new motoring era is finally upon us, and we intend to record the revolution as it happens.”Gadget has already established itself as a leading source of coverage of in-car infotainment systems, autonomous vehicle technology, and the evolution of EVs. It has been a forerunner of demonstrating these technologies in South Africa, and has tested EVs across the world.Gadget also introduced a tech news channel on the Ayoba app, a chat and information app that has more than 12 million users across Africa. Within three weeks, the Gadget channel had more than 20,0000 followers.“We are seeing a thirst for technology insights, perspectives and reviews throughout the continent,” says Goldstuck. “We expect similar demand for information on the technology that will be powering our vehicles in the coming years.”GadgetWheels can be visited at https://gadget.co.za/wheels.
