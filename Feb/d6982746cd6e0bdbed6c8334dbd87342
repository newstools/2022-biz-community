One person was apprehended by Transnet security personnel and handed over to the police. Two other people are still at large.The coach in question had been taken to Koedoespoort for repairs after being involved in a derailment last November at the Salvokop Train Yard in Pretoria and then again at Union Station near Germiston.While the service is suspended, Blue Train staff will be deployed to the depot and offices "until further notice", Times Live reported.Transnet said it would work over the next few days "on how best to manage the situation".
