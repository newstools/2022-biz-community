This is equivalent to almost twice the height of the tallest building in South Africa, The Leonardo in Sandton, Johannesburg. Champagne was another favourite last year with 6,213 litres of champagne being ordered. This is enough to fill almost six standard jacuzzis.On 13 and 14 February last year, one brand of chocolate saw 200 chocolate slabs being ordered on the app. Close to 800 desserts were ordered leading up to the day, with cinnamon sugar doughnuts taking the top order.Dinner orders were the most popular between 5pm and 7pm, with the most expensive being a dinner for two amounting to just under R2,000, the dinner included oysters, a seafood platter for two and a crème brûlée to wrap up the evening. From the e-hailing side, restaurants and bars saw the highest number of requests on the day, followed by various  hotels in and around Johannesburg and Cape Town.  “While Valentine’s Day treats and spoils are quite popular with South Africans, we are excited to see what interesting items make the list for this year.
