Busy Corner Imbizo Shisanyama founder, Rita 'MaZwane' Zwane, tells DStv about the value a DStv Business subscription added to her customers’ experience during the 2010 World Cup: patrons could enjoy her menu and stay on top of all the soccer action at the same time. Rita has since added more TV screens around her establishment to round out the Imbizo experience. “Part of the Imbizo experience is about family and friends, it’s about creating great memories. Without the DStv Business Play package, the experience is not complete.”Jenny-Lee Bot, who runs Molly Malones, speaks about the 'good cheer' that DStv brings to her business: “On Sundays we tune in to DStv and we show it on the big screen. Cricket, rugby, Formula 1 – all the big sporting events. Not only do the people inside enjoy it, but the roadhouse customers enjoy it [too].”The loyal customer base comes back again and again for the friendly service and the communal experience of supporting South African sport by tuning into live matches.DStv Business is tailored to meet the needs of your business and keep your customers satisfied.
