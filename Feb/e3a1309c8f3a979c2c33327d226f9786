"After almost two very difficult years due to the global pandemic, we are elated to be partnering with the SA Polo Association again to create a premium experience for our stakeholders and broader Nedbank community. The polo has continuously proven its sophistication, which we believe is the perfect partnership for us,” says Nedbank Group executive: marketing and corporate affairs, Khensani Nobanda.Image suppliedThe sporting fixture is the longest-running polo test match with a history spanning over 30 years. In what promises to be a thrilling polo encounter, England, who have not played in this International for 32 years, will be taking on South Africa. A combination of elegance, premium hospitality, world-class entertainment and global sporting excellence will be at the forefront of this event. The day promises an exhilarating and action-packed polo match and guests are expected to put their best fashion foot forward.  The fact that polo seasons in both countries take place over the same months, and that players of this standard are in high demand from patrons, explains why there haven’t been more frequent tours between South Africa and England. Spectators are in for a treat as the two sides will be evenly matched on handicap.This year the Nedbank International Polo will adhere to strict Covid protocols and welcome 2,000 spectators and 250 guests in the VIP lounge. Attendees without an ID and valid vaccination card will not be granted access to the grounds.Click here for more information.
