A limited number of music fans will be able to attend this unique event in person, while the rest of the country will enjoy it online – for free. "The event has such a rich heritage," says Tessa van Staden, CapeTalk station manager. "Traditionally it's a time when families come together to enjoy each other’s company to the tune of great music. That hasn't changed – fans can look forward to enjoying the music in their lounge, on the lawn or for a limited amount of fans – in person."  This year the event celebrates home grown female musicians. The Lady Day Big Band is South Africa’s first all-female big band, consisting entirely of professional female musicians. They'll be joined onstage by Cape Town Idols winners Sasha-Lee Davis (2009 winner), Berry Trytsman (2021 winner) and Karin Kortje (2005 winner) on vocals. CapeTalk presenters Refilwe Moloto, Pippa Hudson, Africa Melane and other personalities will also join the festivities broadcast online world-wide.  The event is once again sponsored by South Africa’s favourite Thai food restaurant, Simply Asia. "Covid-19 has changed so many aspects of our lives. We love the idea that people can still experience the music, togetherness, nostalgia, good food and community that make Moonstruck such an institution in Cape Town. And what better way to experience it than with a delicious Simply Asia take-away," says Enzo Cocca, group general manager, Simply Asia Group.All virtual viewers need to register on capetalk.co.za to gain access to the 90 minute, live streamed Youtube event on Saturday 12 February at 6.30pm.
