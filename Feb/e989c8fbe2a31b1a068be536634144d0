Rooftop PV systems and efficient utility management will also be core to the development. CEO of Exemplar, Jason McCormick, is excited to bring retail back to the community: “The damage to the mall and the impact it had on the micro-economy of the community was devastating to witness. The riots had a disastrous impact on small businesses. Many of our local tenants have closed and won’t be reopening their doors. But this has provided us with the unexpected opportunity of finding new talent while providing a refreshed tenant mix that speaks directly to the immediate needs of the community.” Greater Edendale Mall.

Both Mandeni Mall and Theku Plaza were repaired and trading by December last year.
