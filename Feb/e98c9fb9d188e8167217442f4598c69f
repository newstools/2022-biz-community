TUT's Dean Smuts named a regional winner in the 2022 Corobrik Student Architecture Awards“It is a privilege to represent the TUT Department of Architecture, and also to have my project represented on such a prestigious platform,” says Smuts.Facilitating the transition from boyhood to manhoodEntitled ‘Se(cure)ing boys’ to men: The design of a contemporary rites of passage tailoring facility for at-risk boys in the Pretoria CBD’, the project proposes a functional facility to facilitate rites of passage or the transition from boyhood to manhood by implementing the artisanal methods of teaching the art of tailoring.The personal experience of observing a family member mentoring an eight-year-old at-risk boy during the 2020 Covid-19 hard lockdown informed the project context and brought about awareness of the existence of at-risk boys in society. “I became a first-hand witness of a neglected but legitimate societal problem. I became interested in exploring tailoring as an art form. The parallels between tailoring and architecture as a symbiotic relationship further inspired the topic,” says Smuts.35th Corobrik Architectural Student of the Year Awards - Tshwane University of Technology:Winner: Dean Smuts, R10,000First Runner-up: Kyle Posthumus, R8,000Second Runner-up: Jaco Swart, R6,000Best Use of Clay Masonry: Kirti Mistry, R6,000UP student named regional winner in 2022 Corobrik Student Architecture Awards1 Feb 2022This year's national awards will again be a hybrid event held in May, following a similar format as in 2021.
