My work also involves helping startups craft their stories and get coverage in the mediums that matter most to them. This is all in addition to the traditional marketing duties that I execute on a daily basis..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What’s really behind your mask - literally and figuratively speaking?An introvert who loves being around her daughter and loved ones. Super awkward and sometimes shy in large gatherings which is crazy because my job dictates that I be in such spaces most of the time. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Growing up, what did you want to be?A writer for Vogue or Glamour magazine. Working at a fashion magazine was my dream..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How did you end up in the startup landscape?I was a lifestyle blogger interested in startups and a series of events led to me getting a life-changing gig with Impact Hub. In my role, I interacted with startups and I realised that storytelling was an important yet lacking piece of the startup success equation. So I started consulting and writing for startups and other ecosystem supporters..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What excites you most about your career?Getting to work with startups and watching them go through the accelerator process excites me the most. Our programs help startups through essential stages in their building process and when founders achieve milestones like getting their first major partner or achieving a fundraising goal, it is really exciting..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What has been the highlight of your career?My very first physical demo day as part of the team was epic. The programme was virtual because of lockdown restrictions but we had the opportunity to all converge at our new campus in Dakar and it was great!.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}When you're not busy working, what do you do? How do you socialise these days?I'm mostly busy travelling for work when I am not working! But it is also an awesome opportunity to see the magnificence that is awash in Africa. I am an avid reader and Netflix subscriber as well! .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are you watching/reading/listening to at the moment?I actually watch too much Netflix. I'm currently reading Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future and I have Dawn FM by The Weekend on repeat..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What’s next for you?I am excited to see where this role takes me.
