The new website, with a more dynamic and intuitive user interface, is an interactive archive of all of the company’s content work, which allows clients to browse work that matches their brief.  “I think the new Fort website represents a great creative partnership between two companies that are at the top of their game in their respective fields. I think it is an example of what’s possible when companies come together to assist each other to become the best versions of themselves and we are very thankful and grateful for the opportunity to have worked with Havas on this exciting project,” said Shukri Toefy, cofounder of Fort.

We worked closely with the team to create an online home for Fort that’s easy to navigate, while effectively showing everything they do best,” said Havas Johannesburg in a company statement.
