This shift is designed to improve ROI ratings for exhibitors, enhance the visitors’ experience, and also offer opportunities to network, collaborate and build new relationships between designers.100% Design South Africa is the country’s largest exhibition of contemporary design in Africa and showcases furniture and product design, as well as art, literature and craft. As Africa’s only international design show, 100% Design South Africa attracts thousands of buyers from across the continent, and as far away as France, Hong Kong, Italy, the UAE, UK, USA, New Zealand and Brazil.Both curated shows, managed by RX Africa, will feature innovations in homeware, architecture and lifestyle products for the residential, commercial, hospitality and office sector.A series of new features with curation at its core and guided by key insights will also be launched. Each addresses a specific need, desire, gap or opportunity, including Campus, Unorthodox, Shop Decorex, Future Present, Circular Lab and Material Futures.Source: SuppliedBrand refreshDecorex Africa also relaunches this year with a refreshed brand identity. "To evolve the Decorex brand identity in a manner that pays homage to its legacy, while leading it into the future, a new design system had to be created to allow room for play and evolution, while envisioning the identity as a sum of its parts as opposed to individual elements," RX Africa said.
