Kwanalu, however, emphasises the importance of all tiers of government operating efficiently and effectively.  "The decay and collapse of government departments and municipalities whose primary function is to provide services, such as infrastructure including roads, bridges, rail, safe water and electricity, is critical to the survival of the agricultural sector," said Sandy La Marque, CEO.  "Greater accountability is required, officials need to return to work and be committed to ensuring that their function aids the sector, and the entire country, in moving forward and realising economic growth," said La Marque.
