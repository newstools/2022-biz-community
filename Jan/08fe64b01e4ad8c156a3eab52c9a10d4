Dubbed "the godfather of 80s power dressing", he was best known for structured silhouettes featuring statement shoulders and cinched waists. He was equally known for his highly stylised, often 'other-wordly' themed runway shows. During his career, Mugler designed signature looks for Grace Jones, David Bowie, Diana Ross, Beyonce, Lady Gaga and Kim Kardashian.
