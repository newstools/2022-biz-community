Their expertise and insight will be invaluable when determining this year’s winners and which innovative, creative work will stand the test of time and inspire a global community of creative thinkers,” says Keenan.Following the success of past virtual editions, D&AD will continue its digital-first approach to the 2022 awards to guarantee the safety of its members, jury, and participants. D&AD’s distinguished jurors will once again assemble virtually to review the work, holding each piece to the same high standards that the awards are renowned for. The only exceptions are the Book Design, Graphic Design, Magazine & Newspaper Design, Packaging Design and Product Design categories, where in-person judging is essential. Entries for the awards will be closing on Wednesday 16th March 2022. For further information about the categories and how to enter visit the D&AD website here
