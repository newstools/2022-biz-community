In fact, the turnaround in the amount of retail that is now conducted online has probably tripled in just two years. That’s at least a 300% growth in traffic...in just two years!#BizTrends2022: What's next for retailing in Africa?By Christele Chokossa 5 Jan 2022So the market has moved online in a big way.Technology-wise, platforms like Shopify and logistics firms of all shapes and sizes have made cheaper access to the tools for online shopping even easier to recruit and customise. New thinking around customer data analysis and the dashboards that power this valuable insight are also now almost freely available, which means that a perfect storm of opportunity has radically changed the retail landscape for entrepreneurs.Why would you even now bother to waste your time trying to navigate your way through the bureaucratic nightmare that is a traditional retail route-to-market?Going the traditional route now means that you are volunteering to give up your financial margin as well as forfeiting the opportunity to build a valuable direct relationship with your customers. In exchange, you get to tear your hair out as just another supplier that serves this massive money-making machine.Knowing this, Nike has now famously decided to build its own direct-to-consumer assets, so too have Frito Lay and many other well-known brands. What this means is that farmers can now build direct relationships with the people that want to consume their produce without having to go via middlemen. #BizTrends2022: Dear Retail. Let me cheer you up.By Howard Saunders 5 Jan 2022Entrepreneurs who make things can now empower themselves with the ability to fully control their own brand experiences; avoiding being regulated down into a dogfight for limited shelf space with other value creators.2022 is the year that the 'great retail powershift' will pick up momentum. The decentralisation of the marketplace is finally here. Let’s get to work building a new network of empowered entrepreneurs that can really showcase the best of what we have to offer.
