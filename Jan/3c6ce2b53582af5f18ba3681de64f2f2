In these times of pandemic, it’s easy to feel like you are missing out on real-world events, and that is why such an initiative becomes really revitalising and motivating. So I’m grateful to the judging panel, the University of Bournemouth and FIPP, which I am proud to join.” The main if:book New Media Writing Prize award of the evening went to UK entry Neurocracy, produced by Joannes Truyens and collaborators, is a sci-fi hypertext game that allows players to freely explore the Wikipedia of the year 2049.
