“We have spent the past six months building a good, solid foundation for the sound of Hot 102.7FM but we believe with your help we can make Hot 102.7FM a great station,” says Madurai. He has challenged radio listeners to take Jo'burg’s 2022 radio check-up survey and make the big switch to the all new Hot 102.7FM. Madurai says: “I love radio, but most of all I want to lead a radio station that listens to its audience and gives them what they want to hear from their favourite station”.Jo'burg’s 2022 radio check-up is an honest survey of what listeners really think about their radio stations. The online survey will run for a period of eight weeks with questions about music preferences, programming content, favourite presenters, charity initiatives and, most of all, your opinion on how radio can be made better for you.
