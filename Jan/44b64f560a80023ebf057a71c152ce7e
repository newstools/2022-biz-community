We are excited to be able to communicate Bestmed’s intention to provide quality, affordable healthcare cover to many more South Africans,” says Nicola Tarr, Business Unit Direct at Tribeca PR.A report by the Council for Medical Schemes (CMS) shows that Bestmed was the only one of the top five open schemes to grow its member base in 2020. The organisation also received the highest rating in the South African Customer Satisfaction Index (SA-csi) for 2021, on overall quality, perceived value, overall customer service index, and customer loyalty in the medical aid industry. “We consistently strive to provide the best healthcare solutions for our members. With Tribeca as our communications partner, we look forward to communicating our key objectives of providing value for money medical cover and excellent service to our members,” says Denelle Morais, Manager: Marketing and Communication for Bestmed.
