Design Indaba Emerging Creative, Buhle NkalasheThe platform, that has been supporting South Africa’s fresh talent for 17 years, received more than 380 entries this year. The Emerging Creatives programme is designed to hone talent and provide participants with strategies to take their work to the next level and to market.Over the years, the Design Indaba Emerging Creatives platform has successfully launched the careers of a number of gifted creatives, including the likes of Mpho Vackier, Russell Abrahams, Daniel Ting Chong, Crystal Birch, and scores of others.“We are delighted to continue our annual support for our country’s young creatives, particularly in a constrained pandemic environment,” says Design Indaba founder Ravi Naidoo. Innovation in design-led problem-solvingThe Class of 2022 was selected by curators Lukhanyo Mdingi and Ditiro Mashigo - both well-known fashion designers who also happen to be former emerging creatives themselves. Both were impressed by the high quality of the submissions. “I’m incredibly inspired to see the brewing and exceptional talent of the emerging creatives,” says Mdingi. “Year after year, Design Indaba has provided a platform for aspiring designers at large to showcase their work and what they have to offer the industry. They are to be commended for this,” adds Mdingi. In sifting through the many submissions, Mashigo’s agenda was to seek out "innovation in design-led problem-solving and an honest point of view from South African emerging design talents on issues of climate change, socio economics and equality". Creative thinking a survival skillCongratulations to all those who have come through the rigorous curatorial selection process – this year’s emerging creatives are enormously talented, and we look forward to seeing the Class of 2022’s contribution,” says Dr Stella Khumalo, Department of Sport, Arts and Culture (DSAC).“The pandemic has shown us that creative thinking is not a luxury but a survival skill, so nurturing creative talent is vital. We are proud to partner with the Design Indaba once again to invest in the future of the South Africa’s creative industries,” adds Khumalo.  Naidoo adds: “We are grateful to our partner, the DSAC for its ongoing commitment to stand with the rising stars of tomorrow.” The 2022 inductees are:Luke RudmanCharity VilakaziJulia Duduzile MohanoeKutlwano MonyaiMona-lisa MthethwaNandipha YantaNuraan KhanLumka JordaanNaomi ZwaneAmy-Leigh BraafDaniella KilpatrickKatlego MaganoLundi MlonyeniMbangiso MabasoMishaal GangaramMoeko Karabelo SelebaloMohau MoholaneNjabulo MasekoRiyaadh IsmailSamkelo Boyde XabaSibusiso FeniSiyabonga MtshaliSizani BaloyiThulani KubekaFernandoKyle KeminkFikile SokhuluDrew Kendall Haller Nkululeko MthembuTsepiso LekganyaneNoxolo Thando MasukuLindiwe Irene Rethebile GugusheMikhailia PetersenThando NtuliLehlogonolo KhaasLauren GerickeLeila WalterAkshar MaganbeharieArron MoosBuhle NkalasheThe young designers handpicked for the 2022 edition will be introduced to the public via an extended virtual exhibition and Design Indaba’s thriving social media channels.
