“By concentrating on individuals, teams and organisations from a wealth of disciplines from CEOs to Young entrepreneurs, large corporations to sole traders, best procurement to best innovation and everything in between, our awards endeavour to identify and celebrate those who fall within the Business Insight umbrella, whilst not forgetting the advisors who helped to get them there,” says Charlotte Abbott, from Global Business Insight.DUO Marketing + Communications has a 17-year track record as a niche PR and digital marketing agency that specialises in servicing B2B tech brands in sub-Saharan Africa.  The company represents growing South African tech companies who are ready to scale into the continent, as well as international companies that are looking to strengthen their brand in Africa.“We are humbled and grateful to once again be acknowledged for our PR and Digital marketing strengths at DUO. Our team has worked exceptionally hard over the past year and we will continue to do so as our team expands to support our growing business” says CEO Judith Middleton.This latest win brings to four the total number of international awards that DUO has secured over the past year, primarily as a result of nomination by the company's clients rather than being through a traditional awards submission.
