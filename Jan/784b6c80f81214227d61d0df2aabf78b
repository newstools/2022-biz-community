The highest scoring organisations are recognised based on the Top Employers Institute’s global ranking policy. The policy stipulates that the number of certified Top Employers in a specific country and continental certification programme determines the nature of the overall ranking component. Global FMCG company Unilever reigns as the No. 1 Top Employer in Africa, JTI in second place, followed by Vodacom in third place. The average score per organisation determines the overall ranking for the continental programme. This average is determined using the results from the countries with the four highest scores. These are calculated to represent an average organisational score which is used for ranking purposes. The overall Top 20 Top Employers in South Africa includes Unilever South Africa in first position, followed by Accenture (South Africa), and Vodacom Group. To succinctly summarise, these are the highest scoring companies that achieved a ranking continentally and in a specific African country.
