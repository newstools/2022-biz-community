While the event has always been known to be a fair filled with A-list stars enjoying the merriment of celebration, this year looked remarkably different. Instead of it being televised as it usually is, the winners were announced on Twitter by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), as well as a live blog - without the glitz and glamour. It's been our esteemed pleasure to celebrate such incredible talent and a true honor to work with so many amazing organizations. To everyone nominated and all the winners, thank you for everything you do to bring the love of TV and Film to global communities, 365 days of the year pic.twitter.com/z2514bYzQd— Golden Globe Awards (@goldenglobes) January 10, 2022The Power of the Dog and Belfast saw seven nominations in the film categories, and Succession saw five nominations - with Ted Lasso and The Morning Show just behind with four nominations in the TV show categories. Traditionally, the Golden Globes is closely watched and engaged with by pop-culture fans, but something changed this year. Overshadowed by the boycott from Hollywood studios, the glamour of The Golden Globes was lost. The boycott was the result of questionable practices from HFPA over years, whose members vote on the awards.
