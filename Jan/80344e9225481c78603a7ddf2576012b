Social media was abuzz with some hilarious tweets from viewers, and even some celebrities, when e.tv announced the line-up for their popular 8pm slot last week. The Anaconda movie flighted at 8pm on e.tv and saw over 2.4 million fans tuning in. The movie is an old favourite, and even though you know that snake is about to strike, you can’t stop watching. Some viewers commented, “We love it,” and “It might be old, but I keep watching.” “Anaconda is an old-time favourite and we know our audiences are hooked on suspense,” says Marlon Davids, MD e channels. “We will continue to bring the drama, suspense and thrills to viewers."
