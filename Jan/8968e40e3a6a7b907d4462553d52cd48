To be able to see trended and comparative data since the 2019 study will be of great benefit,” said the BRC’s CEO, Gary Whitaker. The Infinite Dial has been published in six countries around the world, and provides broadcasters, online audio publishers, podcasters, advertisers and the financial community with insightful data around consumption of streaming radio, online music and podcasts, as well as the usage of smart speakers and more. The Infinite Dial South Africa explores the consumption of audio among South Africans living within the major metro commercial areas, covering the upper two of the three SEM Supergroups (or upper three of the five SEM Clusters). “We believe that the broader scope of the study will make for a richer and more comprehensive dataset, and we look forward to releasing the full results,” concludes Whitaker.
