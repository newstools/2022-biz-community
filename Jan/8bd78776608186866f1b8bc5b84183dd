In the 1980s and 90s he served in number of key roles at Vogue, including editor-at-large for the brand. “Talley worked at WWD, Interview, Vanity Fair, House & Garden and Vogue, in between dancing at Studio 54, interviewing Rihanna on the Met Gala red carpet, and Michelle Obama for the pages of Vogue. With his baritone voice, vibrant caftans and unmistakable presence, Talley was a forthright personality in an industry filled with notable forces,” says WWD.comThe Hollywood Reporter describes him as “towering figure in fashion, both literally given he was 6-foot-6 and figuratively due to a career that spanned six decades.“Talley wrote about fashion at a number of publications including Women’s Wear Daily, W and even a brief stint at the New York Times. But it is American Vogue that he is indelibly associated with, serving variously as the magazine’s news director, creative director and as well as editor-at-large working closely with EIC Anna Wintour,” says the publication.Pioneering fashion journalist André Leon Talley died on January 18.
