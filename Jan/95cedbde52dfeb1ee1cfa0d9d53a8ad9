These days, the word ‘value’ has become nebulous amongst both consumers and marketers. It’s often misused, overused, and, as a result, has lost a lot of its meaning. However, Burger King’s King of the Day special aims to reclaim the notion of value, offering a different full-sized burger from their regular menu, every day, for only R29,90.  “It’s important to us to offer value for money that isn’t cheap, but rather good quality, freshly made burgers, and available in a variety of choices,” says Ezelna Jones, marketing executive at Burger King. It was a useful insight to tap into, especially considering the Januworry squeeze everyone is feeling.  This allowed Grey to create a humorous campaign that leveraged just how expensive things have gotten and then juxtapose this with true Burger King value. The result was a campaign that managed to walk a fine line between brand and retail, showcasing both the concept and the deal.  Launched as outdoor and social, the campaign was spearheaded by two TV spots depicting people trying to purchase different necessities (petrol and shoes) for just R29,90.  “Burger King is a globally iconic brand that has produced some of the most influential campaigns ever, so it was a delight to work with them. It’s also always such a pleasure to work on food retail campaigns that have a simple, clear message – which, in this case, is exceptional value for money deals,” said Glenn Jeffery, executive creative director at Grey  When looking for a director who could capture the right nuanced balance, Grey approached Jozua Malherbe of 7Films. “What I loved about the script was the simplicity and strength of the idea. I opted to shoot the spot in as few shots as possible relying rather on the actor's performance and wow did that pay off for us. It’s funny, relevant, and memorable - and what a treat to make.” said Malherbe.  Although times may be a little tough, Burger King is letting everyone know that there are some places you don't have to tighten your belt – quite the opposite, in fact.
