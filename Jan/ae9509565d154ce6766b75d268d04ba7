We can do our work and socialise under less stringent restrictions, and our lives can return to some degree of normality. “As individuals, we must carefully consider the implications of the risk to ourselves of being unvaccinated and the risk of spreading the infection to our children, parents, relatives, co-workers and those we do not even know,” said President Ramaphosa.
