The station's Hotbusters gang is "busting" businesses that play Hot 102.7FM for their staff and customers, rewarding them with pizza from Papachinos and an exclusive Hot 102.7FM decal to proudly display their support of Hot 102.7FM. “We love it that more people are switching on to Hot 102.7FM every day and that our on-air feel-good vibe is being carried into retail stores and businesses for the benefit of staff and customers,” says Lloyd Madurai, managing director of Hot 102.7FM. “We’re getting invaluable feedback from our listeners in the 2022 Joburg Radio Check-up, and we are constantly striving to make a better radio station for Joburg’s discerning listeners. Through 'busting' and rewarding businesses that play Hot 102.7FM to their staff and customers, we’re giving something back to those who support us.” Hotbusters will take place every weekday. Businesses that want to be visited by the Hotbusters crew can send their details to az.oc.7201toh@sretsubtoh.
