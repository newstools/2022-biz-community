Now that we’re on the same page, there’s only one teeny tiny question: where to from here? Lockdowns and new variants aside, brands and students still need to connect.This is where Fresher’s Box comes in. Launched 2020 during O-week, Fresher’s gives students a new way to interact with brands through swag and other gear, packaged in a branded box, to help them ease into the new year.Covid-19 may have changed how Fresher’s are distributed, but whether students will be on campus, off campus or working remotely, they will still get the chance to get fresh.This year, our goal is to take Fresher’s nationally with a series of Fresher’s Box Activations, spanning 10 campuses, including branded stands and experiences where we will be distributing thousands of boxes (safely) while promoting participating brands through our 250k strong social network. If you want SA’s students to get fresh with your brand, or to learn more about what we have in store for 2022, contact az.oc.egallivtneduts@onoj or slide into our DM’s on LinkedIn or Facebook.About Student VillageWe are youth market specialists.
