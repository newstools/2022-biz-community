Today marks one year since the passing of the former resident DJ at Kaya 959 and highly accomplished figure in the entertainment industry. DJ 1D, as he was affectionately known to his fans, was an iconic storyteller and will be remembered for his radio work and documenting South African street culture through SABC 1’s Evolution Of Street Culture lifestyle show.“Wandi was a pioneer and created not only a brand that South Africans will be proud of, but also blessed the family of staff at Kaya with his warmth and generosity. He will be remembered most for his infectious laugh, commendable work ethic and fruitful efforts of showcasing the artistry that exists in South African street culture,” says programming manager, Maekanya Morotoba.Kaya 959’s Breakfast hosts Thomas and Skhumba kicked off the tribute with a DJ 1D kwaito mix, followed by a recap of the memorial service and a conversation with Dope Dad Founders – a foundation that was close to 1D’s heart.
