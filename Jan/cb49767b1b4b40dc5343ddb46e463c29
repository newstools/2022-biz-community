Publications need not have international readership to qualify.“Now more than ever, it is critical that we foster programmes like the Tabbies that honour and celebrate the phenomenal work that B2B print and visual journalists continue to produce in spite of today’s many global challenges,” says Trade, Association, and Business Publications International (TABPI) president Paul J. Heney. Changing business modelsHeney says that the past two years have prompted many organisations to rethink their business models, including publishing companies that have been restructuring as leaner operations. “We know that keeping valuable people on our teams is becoming increasingly difficult, and individual and team recognition is more important than ever. “The core mission of the Tabbie Awards is to recognise our professionals who help drive excellence through their talent and commitment to journalistic excellence,” he says. Being honoured in an editorial and design competition can serve as a critical marketing tool for publications. “Winning showcases your brand’s focus on quality content. I’ve seen many publications successfully leverage their wins in competitions like the Tabbies.“They promote the accolades to both readers and advertisers, showing they are a reputable and valuable information source,” he adds.
