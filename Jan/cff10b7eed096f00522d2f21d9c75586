Winners of Student Photographer of the Year and Youth Photographer of the Year will be announced on 12 April and will go on display as part of the Sony World Photography Awards 2022 exhibition at Somerset House, London from 13 April to 2 May, 2022. Student competition shortlistThe Student shortlist showcases a series of works by 10 students at leading international higher education institutions. For the 2022 competition, students were invited to submit a series of five to 10 images interpreting the brief ‘Connections’. Over the past two years, we have had to think differently about how we connect in more ways than we could have imagined. The shortlisted entries have each been chosen for their nuanced and intelligent responses to this brief. Connections to cultural identity and community are examined by several of the projects:The Identity of Holland by Ezra Bohm (Nederlandse Acedemie voor Beeldcreatie) which focuses on the inhabitants of the Dutch village of Urk, the last people in the Netherlands to still wear traditional dressBecoming South African by Aidan Murgatroyd (Stellenbosch Academy of Design and Photography) follows the photographer's journey in search of a greater understanding and sense of connection to his home country after prolonged absencesTheologians by Sergey Pronin (Docdocdoc School of Modern Photography) captures participants seeking a spiritual connection in the summer camp of St. Tikhon's Orthodox University's Theological facultyThe Butcher by Dennis Mubanga Kabwe (Open Window University Zambia) spotlights a local butcher at work in the heart of the market-placeCariño by Chris Rosas Vargas (Parsons), a series of sentimental portraits of public spaces in the Bronx and Harlem.Elsewhere the series explore connections through representations of togetherness:Tiramisu by Alexander Komenda (Aalto University) which depicts Komenda's playful collaborations with fellow students to help pass the time during the lockdownsDisconnected by Oriel Naxhielly Martins (ENFO Escuela De Fotografía), where the photographer focuses on moments of physical intimacy and the struggle of coping with isolation during the pandemic.Connections to the past, and to family history were also central to several of the projects:Connections by Sachi Deshmukh (Nuova Accademia di Belle Arti), which juxtaposes past and present through old photographs of her then newly married parents held by their now aged hands and linked together with red threadMemories of Family by Xu Han (Nanjing University of the Arts) uses close-up abstract images of paint droplets and patterns to explore the photographer's relationship with familyEven When We're Breathing, We're Moving by Angela Stoll (University of Wollongong) examines the idea of movement as a passage of time through long-exposure black and white images of a dancer within an abandoned space.The winner of Student Photographer of the Year 2022 will be selected from the ten students and announced on 12 April.
