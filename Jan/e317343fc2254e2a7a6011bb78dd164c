By choosing the Out of Homes platform the brand had direct engagement with consumers and creatively interacting with them in a memorable way.  Placed at key locations in and around South Africa, consumers could have a laugh while seeking shade from the sun and rain. The Savanna Twidder Shade benches were designed to look like trees with leaves covered in Twitter Shade messages.“With our tongues firmly in our cheeks, we turned Twitter shade into real shade by building bespoke TwirraShade trees, alongside the very clever team over at Thinking. The result is a cut-through outdoor campaign, which is supported by a robust social and digital campaign designed to get people talking and engaging”, says Steph van Niekerk Creative Director Grey / WPP Liquid.Savanna’s known for its crisp witty take on the ironies of South African life under the banner of #SiyavannaSouthAfrica, and this campaign is an ode to South African Twitter with socially and culturally relevant content, and the campaign’s teaser went viral within hours after launch. “Like all good ideas, the #TwirraShadeProject started as a joke. We figured that there’s so much shade being thrown around on Black Twitter every day, if we could harness it, we could probably solve the global warming crisis – I mean there is shade for days, shade for millennia really. So that’s what we did.
