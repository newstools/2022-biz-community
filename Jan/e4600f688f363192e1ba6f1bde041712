Directed by Greg Gray of Romance Films, in collaboration with Joe Public United, the new burst of Nuggets has seen Chicken Licken return to its top trending spot on Twitter, this time with an extra tongue-in-cheek surprise. The first film stars one of South Africa’s most talked-about figures: celebrity artist, Rasta. Playing the role of a prospective police sketch artist being interviewed by a police chief, we follow the hilarious consequences that could come of not heeding the Nugget of Wisdom: Choose your sketch artist wisely. The second film helps the nation navigate safely to the end of its Januworries with a sage new Nugget of Wisdom: no matter how tempting your cash-strapped inclination might be not to do so – Always put in petrol. “One of the biggest rewards of collaborating with Chicken Licken is the opportunity not only to serve the growth of the brand, but in many ways, of the nation as a whole. By creating common ground that gives us all permission to laugh together – even at ourselves – we can draw people together, rather than driving them apart,” says integrated chief creative officer, Xolisa Dyeshana, Joe Public United.As promised, SoulBites Nuggets of Wisdom will continue to roll out into February across media channels, to help South Africans laugh their way out of trouble and keep things running relatively smoothly for a – dare we say it? – great 2022. #SoulBitesTwitter: @ChickenLickenSAFacebook: Chicken LickenYouTube: Chicken Licken SACredits:Brand: Chicken LickenGroup Chief Creative Officer: Pepe MaraisIntegrated Chief Creative Officer:	Xolisa DyeshanaIntegrated Creative Director: Assaf LevyIntegrated Senior Copywriter: Michelle McKenna Integrated Senior Art Director: Alexa CranerIntegrated Copywriter: Tlhogi SwaratlheIntegrated Art Director: Ovayo NtlabatiCreative Business Director: Amber MackeurtanAccount Manager: Sinethembe SkondeHead of TV & Radio: Di ColeDirector: Greg GrayExecutive Producer: Helena WoodfineLine Producer: Shannon McDougall	Director of Photography: Adam BentelProduction Art Director: Will BoyesStylist | Costume Design: Bridget BakerHead of Research: Maghiel van DorssenPrincipal Actors: Rasta, Mpho Molepo, Sne DladlaEditor: Ricky BoydEditing Company: Deliverance PostVisual Effects: Jean du PlessisPost-production: Chocolate Tribe	Audio & Sound Design: Stephen Webster, Ricky BoydSound Studio: The WorkRoom
