Xola Dlwati“We’re very excited to have Xola on board to host this brand-new spectacular soulful show that will focus on romantic, tender and sweet music for those times when the heart wants what the heart wants. Sundays are an easy and perfect day to relax, reconnect  and rekindle your love and this show provides a perfect platform and mood for those who just love falling in love. Every Sunday, our listeners will be taken down memory lane of their love stories and will be reminded how beautiful love can really be,” said managing director of Kaya 959, Sibongile Mtyali. Xola joined Kaya 959 in November 2021, filling in one of the developmental slots from 2-5am Monday to Friday. Xola is a trained engineer from the Wits Radio Academy. His previous experience includes having spent time in the community radio sector, having hosted shows on Eldos FM until he joined Kaya 959. Expressing his excitement, Xola said, “I am truly humbled and grateful to the bosses at Kaya 959 for trusting me with this new show. I am beyond thrilled and cannot wait to connect with our amazing listeners through a great soulful playlist. I look forward to great on-air moments and to just having fun - a great way to start my new year.” Apart from taking on the new Sunday afternoon slot, Dlwati will continue to host his weekly show Monday-Friday from 2-5am.
