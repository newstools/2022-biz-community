The Leratong Joy For One Foundation is an orphanage that has been caring for local underprivileged children for over 26 years. The donation comes off the back of the success of the recent Kaya 959 Soul Inspired concert in partnership with Spar.The dedicated team of the Leratong Joy For One Foundation is led by the passionate Mama Peggy Chauke, whose vision remains to address the desperate needs of children in this community, one child at a time. The virtual Kaya 959 Soul Inspired concert was live streamed to soul and gospel fans around the country. The line-up included Crown Gospel award-winning musicians Sbu Noah, Ayanda Ntanzi, Hle and Thinah Zungu.“The core purpose of the Kaya 959 Soul Inspired has always been to uplift many hearts with music. For the past two years, the concert focused more on bringing hope during the most difficult time when the world was dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic. This concert afforded us and our partners at Spar, an opportunity to contribute towards easing the burden on everyday heroes like the Leratong Joy For One Foundation. “The Soul Inspired concert speaks to the core values of Spar, and I’m very happy to have our team participate with the fundraising of the Leratong Joy For One Foundation,” says Piet van Vuuren, Spar promotions and advertising manager.
