"We’ve developed a great partnership with Flyt and will continue to work together in sourcing and developing new hotel and leisure opportunities," he said.With the tourism sector on the cusp of a bounce-back, Flyt forecasts a healthy improvement in occupation rates and demand for apart-hotel-type accommodation.
