We were faced with many challenges — at home, in our businesses and beyond. Despite it all, we pushed through,” IAB SA CEO Razia Pillay said at the awards. She went on to detail how the Bookmark Awards is a reflection of how the industry addressed those challenges — “with creativity, innovation and resilience. And it is these qualities that have enabled our industry and the businesses they serve to thrive in a digital economy. You should be incredibly proud of yourselves.”2022 Bookmark Awards live event to celebrate the power of togetherness27 Jun 2022“We are extremely grateful to the creatives in this industry for the work they do.
