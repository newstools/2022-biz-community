(“And there are many shiny objects!”)“The flip side is that if you have the foundational skills, there are so many new aspects to understand and so a degree of upskilling and continuous learning is always there,” she says.If you’re familiar with Professor Mark Ritson’s writings and videos, she explains, you will know this is a regular topic for him – “he says famously or infamously around 50% of marketers have no proper training in marketing”.“He recently wrote about the high levels of Impostor Syndrome in marketing, where he said the best antidote was, of course, to get better at core skills.”#BizTrends2020: Creativity's tipping point in businessBy Gillian Rightford 20 Jan 2020A lack of connection“What makes this worse is that there is a massive disconnect between the C-Suite and marketing in many businesses. Getting better at the job means being able to bridge some of that disconnect,” she states.However, the big barrier to upskilling and continuous growth is time. “Marketing and advertising teams work relentlessly long hours and the 'important-but-not-urgent' aspect of learning falls by the wayside,” she adds.But for her, the biggest frustration is the lack of connection with the client’s business, with weak and fluffy strategy that does not address the challenges in the category and is based on limited consumer understanding.“Both marketers and agencies are guilty of wishful thinking in terms of what the impact of their activities on consumers can hope to achieve,” says Rightford.Understand your strategic processShe explains that the creative process starts with the client brief. “And when I say most of them are dire, it’s a massive understatement. They are un-strategic, with a laundry list of generic and unmeasurable objectives, and a consumer-ask that is all but impossible with a ridiculously small budget.”What she would want for the creative process is that marketers get better at understanding their own strategic process and the million-dollar importance of a good brief that refines and articulates a clear objective.“Then the agencies translate that into meaningful, compelling, and differentiated creative output that doesn’t add to the cacophony of wasted advertising in the universe,” she says.And this is where she hopes that the School of Thought can help, by offering training courses to help in these areas. “The library has wonderful case studies, tools and templates to use, and hopefully the opportunity for mentorship and coaching (both on and off the platform) is something that people buy into.”
