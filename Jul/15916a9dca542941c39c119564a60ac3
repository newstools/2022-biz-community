After the raffle closed and the donations were tallied, it also invited Blackboard schoolgoers to spend the  day in office with them, learning about the world of advertising and interacting with key players in the industry.Supplied.

So, we are thrilled to be launching our 2022 Machine_67 x Blackboard Mandela Day campaign and hope to raise even more funds this year for this amazing community of young people,” says Campbell.In keeping with the aim of the Blackboard initiative, Campbell says as an agency they understand just how important it is to develop young talent. “We have an internal programme, The Forge, that finds and shapes undiscovered talent, with a view to making our industry more accessible.“Blackboard’s slogan is democratising creativity – so it’s a great alignment for us to be working with them on this campaign,” she says.Supplied.

Because we know we need it,” states Campbell.Jabulani Sigege, Machine_’s executive creative director says the initiative is not only the opportunity for their staff members to showcase their creativity, but also create a pipeline to untapped talent -  “Talent that can be mentored and exposed to advertising as a career opportunity from high school”.The artworks“This year, nine of our Machine_ 67 talented staff members donated their time to create a unique piece of art inspired by Nelson Mandela,” says Campbell.The pieces are titled:Reconciling Truth a charcoal and pastel drawing by Marnus Nieuwoudt Synchronicity an illustration by Vuyani MasangoI Never Lose an illustration by Katya WagnerRising an acrylic painting by Marissa SteynI pretended to be a drone a photograph by Celeste JacobsOne Street At A Time a photograph by Roderick LakaElephant - Wisdom a photograph by Louw StrydomUbuntu  an illustration by Riyaaz FreemanEnd of silence a drawing by Francois CoetzeeSupplied.
