This trend is only continuing, leaving many PR and communications professionals feeling helpless as they attempt to obtain earned media coverage for their clients and companies.To address this issue, Propel compiled a series of data reports to enable PR professionals to better focus their pitching and send journalists stories that actually interest them. The company compiles these reports by analysing (and anonymising) the over 350,000 pitches PR professionals sent through the platform’s email plugin to find trends in pitching and journalist response rates. Using these metrics, comms and PR professionals alike are able to adjust their pitching strategies to drive further success. Download the Q3 2022 Media Barometer here.
