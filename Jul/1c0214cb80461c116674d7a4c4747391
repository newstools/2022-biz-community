In just over six months, we have developed new desktop and mobile websites and new apps across the Apple, Google and Huawei app stores."Since Monday [18 July], these are in public beta, meaning the final stages of technical development. They are not perfect, but safe to shop and some early adopters are helping us uncover any bugs or issues before our final public release to all customers, suppliers and stakeholders. We look forward to revealing the final version soon,” said Jedeikin in a statement to Bizcommunity.Bash offers free collection from more than 800 stores nationwide, and free delivery on orders over R500.
