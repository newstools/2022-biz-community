I will make a bold statement and say that without you our democracy would fail. Every one of you here in this room and watching online is a hero and heroine.  We are eternally grateful to you and proud of what you have achieved over the past two years.”Never give up!At the Awards, veteran editor Anthony Heard was honoured with the Allan Kirkland Soga: Lifetime Achiever Award. Heard, who was a shining light in the dark days of Apartheid, gave the audience the thumbs up and shouted, “Never give up!” after receiving his award.Heard says that now, more than ever the media is vulnerable and in need of patrons. “The media, and journalists, must be supported. The enlightened corporations and institutions know that. They need to invest in the media as it is an investment in their future.”He says that journalists are not invincible but some of their actions can lead to major change. “Very few other institutions in society have that capacity.”Investigative journalism is a necessityBy Danette Breitenbach 3 days agoThe value of the industryDaily Maverick’s Pieter-Louis Myburgh expressed surprise at winning Story of the Year for Digital Vibes.
