It is imperative they have access to practical solutions that match the rapid evolution of the digital and legal warfare used to silence them,” says CEO of the Thomson Reuters Foundation, Antonio Zappulla.This is the first tool available to journalists and media practitioners to document and manage online harassment and abuse, enabling them to regain control of their social media feeds, take action against perpetrators, and protect their well-being.Sanef appalled by assault on the Times' photographer by Dudu Myeni13 Apr 2022Limits exposure to abusive contentDeveloped in partnership with Google’s Jigsaw, TRFilter syncs with the user's Twitter account and uses machine learning technology to automatically recognise and flag harmful comments. It limits journalists' exposure to abusive content by allowing them to hide comments and block or mute accounts at scale, without reviewing the content. The tool also allows users to create reports to download and share with third parties as needed, for example their employer or law enforcement.Women journalists disproportionally affectedWhile many journalists are harassed in deliberate efforts to control the free flow of information, women are disproportionately affected. Nearly three-quarters of women journalists have experienced online violence; threats include physical and sexual violence, and even death threats.As women journalists report missing work to recover from incidences of harassment, quitting their jobs, and even leaving the profession altogether, this scourge of online violence has become a workplace safety issue. Last year, TRF partnered with UNESCO, the International Women's Media Foundation and the International News Safety Institute to develop a range of practical and legal tools for journalists, media managers and newsrooms to address the challenges experienced by reporters and media workers and strengthen responses to online and offline harassment.In addition to English, new versions of these guides have been made available in six languages – Russian, Arabic, French, Italian, Spanish and Chinese.

With a legacy of more than 30 years working to bolster the ecosystem for independent media around the world, TRFilter is the latest in a suite of initiatives that TRF, in collaboration with partners, has pioneered to offer journalists practical solutions to defend their mission of reporting the truth and protect them from persecution.
