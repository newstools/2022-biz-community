The platform has seen excellent overseas uptake with CTT recently partnering with the Expedia online travel platform to offer great deals to potential visitors to Cape Town, says Alderman James Vos, the City's mayoral committee member for economic growth."This past month, Cape Town International Airport processed up to 30 663 total passengers in a day. In May, domestic and international passenger numbers recovered to almost 80% of that of the same month in 2019."Our goal is that we will see not only a 100% recovery rate, but that we will surpass the figures seen in 2019. I believe that we will achieve this with initiatives such as these from CTT as it will entice people the world over to find their freedom in the Mother City," concludes Vos.
