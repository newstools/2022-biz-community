In a bid to push the transformation agenda, panel discussions over the two-day summit looked for inspiration and reflected on the transformation journey thus far, providing expert solutions to the recurring issues in the context of transformation and empowerment.Highlights from the summit include discussions around the new BBBEE codes and the implications these changes will have on local businesses; the key role entrepreneurs play in Africa’s economic growth; the township economy; exploring ESD programmes applicable to South Africa; and the impacts of the digital revolution on skills development and transformation.Some key takeouts on actionable insights from top empowered organisations included: The need to continuously adapt and enhance skills to remain in economic competitiveness. A collaborative approach between government, private sector, public sector and SMMEs is needed. Ensuring that connectivity is no longer a challenge, but a basic service to all.                                      Only by creating an enabling environment can we really hope to create an economy that benefits all. If there’s no transformative ownership, nothing is going to change, and the structure of our economy will remain the same and continue to increase inequality.Watch the full awards ceremony here, or the highlights from the 2022 Top Empowerment Summit & Awards here.Click here to view all the finalists.
