Despite the multifaceted challenges South African businesses face, entrepreneurs remain positive and aware that they may require additional support to stay afloat, grow and endure. Grow, and its coaches, have the knowledge and experience to guide established mid-sized businesses through these ever-growing challenges and achieve a positive outcome in growing their business, people and profits.Tackling South Africa’s steep economic slumpAs it stands, South Africa’s economy is facing a multitude of issues that are impeding its growth, including a weaker global environment which heavily impacts trade, a tightening of domestic monetary policy, a further and continuous rise in electricity load shedding, and the adverse impact of local and foreign factors on business supply chains, amongst other factors.At the start of the year, PwC forecasted South Africa’s real GDP growth for 2022 to be 2.5%. This has since been revised to just 1.8% off the back of a global deterioration in economic momentum.PwC’s global economic forecast for 2022 is currently 1.3% lower than estimated at the beginning of the current year. And with an economic ‘slump’ comes a further decrease in job creation, which will, in turn, increase our unemployment rate to new highs in 2022.New and existing entrepreneurs are struggling to stay afloatSouth African business owners argue that the entrepreneurial ecosystem and enabling environment do not adequately assist new or existing entrepreneurs.According to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor expert assessment of entrepreneurial framework conditions, South Africa is the only country of 47 developing and developed nations to have scored below 50% on all framework criteria, making it the sixth worst nation in the world, behind nations such as Iran and Sudan.The factors in which the nation performed poorly included:Ease of access to finance Entrepreneurial-related finance Government policy, support and relevance Entrepreneurial education, post-school Research and developmentTaxes and bureaucracy Burdens and regulationsGrow’s holistic approachSince 2009, Grow has assisted hundreds of entrepreneurs in South Africa with rapid growth to raise their revenues, while reducing their stresses and frustrations.

My advice to people who are thinking about coaching is to take action. Action eliminates fear. If you go for it, you will be surprised what can happen on the other side."Another Grow client, a family dairy business that rivals the biggest in the country, explains: "With coaching, we were forced to look at our business, put it down on paper and be strategic with where we were going. When I look at what we said we would do in the first year, we have tripled that since then."The Growth Formula results speak volumes, with some clients who have partnered with Grow reporting five-fold growth in just three years.To learn more about Grow Business Coaching, please visit https://www.grow.za.com/.
