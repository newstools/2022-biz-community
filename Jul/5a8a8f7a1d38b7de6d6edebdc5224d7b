CEO John Shaw, who founded the school in 2018 says it’s been a tumultuous time for learners, and the school is here to help as many learners as possible. “We cannot pretend that the class of 2022 has not experienced significant academic interruptions over the past two years with the pandemic. We want no student to feel left behind, which is why we are opening these webinars to any matric student with access to a mobile device,” says Shaw.Timetable:Subject Date and TimeMatric Maths Exam Tips in 67 Minutes19 July, 3pmMatric Maths Literacy Exam Tips in 67 Minutes19 July, 3pmMatric Tourism: Major SA Attractions in 67 Minutes20 July, 3pmMatriek Afrikaans Huis Taal Skryfskool in 67 Minute21 July, 3pmTo register, visit https://www.teneoschool.co.za/webinars/
