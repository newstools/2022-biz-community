This means that close to 97% of pitches are ignored by journalists,“ he emphasises.But for him what is perhaps even more worrying for PR professionals is the fact that it’s only getting more difficult to reach journalists.“Our research shows that journalist response rates were 12% higher in Q2 of last year than they were in Q2 of this year. There’s only so much room left before that response rate hits rock bottom,” says Goldstein.Pitches too long9.25% of the pitches that were between 50-150 words long got a response, thereby making this the most responded to pitch length. However, most pitches that PR pros sent were between 500-1,000 words long.“Just for reference, that’s between two and four MS Word pages double-spaced!” he comments.“Journalists get hundreds of pitches per day, and they simply don’t have the time to read whatever novel a PR pro might have written. “Our data shows that journalists and influencers prefer pitches which are short, sweet, and most importantly – to the point,” he says.How public relations have had to evolve with a changing media landscapeBy Gomotsegang Motswatswe 11 Jul 2022Same day responses80% of journalists who open pitches will open a pitch on the same day it’s sent. If they respond to a pitch, then there is a 66% chance they’ll respond on the same day.If the journalist has opened a pitch and hasn’t responded on the same day, he says then there’s still a 33% chance they’ll respond the next day.“However, if they don’t respond within 24 hours, it’s likely they won’t respond at all. Therefore, to maximise the potential for a journalist response (and remember, even a “no” is a response!) we recommend that PR pros send one follow-up email the day after the pitch is sent,” says Goldstein.“If the journalist still doesn’t respond, it’s best to move on,” adds Goldstein.
