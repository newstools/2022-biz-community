He said he had heard numerous complaints about how staff are treated at the company.Azola Mangena, who works at Takealot through a labour broker, said he thought that after a year he would be hired permanently. He has been at Takealot for over three years now.“We are not treated fairly and equally. All the managers here are white people. Same with supervisors. It’s only white people. Not that this is a problem if they qualify, our problem is that they are not treating us very well. Here workers have no say.“You cannot argue because the minute you argue, management will show you the door or tell you to go complain to your labour broker,” said Mangena.Takealot's new Richmond Park pickup point comes with robot helpers5 May 2022Many workers who spoke to GroundUp asked to remain anonymous.

We are disappointed that despite our attempts to discuss their concerns, they have opted not to return to work and follow the internal grievance processes and engage with management.”“Prior to today’s unprotected strike, there have been no grievances formally raised by staff to management at this distribution centre. We have commenced engagement with representatives of the majority of employees who are not involved in the unprotected strike, to clarify and address concerns.”Read the original article on GroundUp.
