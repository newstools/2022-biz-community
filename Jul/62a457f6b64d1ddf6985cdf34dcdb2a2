Nestlé states that the benefit of using recycled aluminium is linked to the amount of energy saved in the production of aluminum and that it's well suited to the circular economy.Nicole Roos, business executive officer for beverages at Nestlé East and Southern Africa Region explains, “With every material we use to produce the capsules, we are committed to ensuring that none of our packaging ends up in landfill or as litter and aim to minimise the impact of our packaging on the environment.“This includes advocating for adequate recycling infrastructure for coffee capsules regardless of the material used. In addition, aluminium can be re-melted and reused infinitely, giving it a second life.”Responsible corporate citizenship in CPG: Proof is in the packaging28 Jun 2022Preserving freshness, aromasThe recycled aluminum comes from a variety of sources including post-consumer scrap as well as scrap recovered during the production processes.Using 80% recycled aluminium is not only better for the environment, but aluminum is also one of the best materials to keep freshness and protect the aromas of coffee, notes Nestlé, adding that it provides an exceptional barrier to oxygen, light and humidity and is therefore an excellent choice to protect volatile aromas and freshness for a long time.Nestlé rolls out RE Sustainability initiative in South Africa29 Oct 2020“By using 80% recycled aluminum, we demonstrate the recyclability of aluminium and want to encourage our consumers to recycle their aluminium capsules.
