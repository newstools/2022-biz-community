In addition, they regarded it as their duty to enlighten the public about the value and the beauty of works of developing artists. Many of these artists became well-known and are today recognised as being amongst the top artists our country has produced.The 2022 August Art Month pays homage to Die Kunskamer, the late Louis Schachat and to Charlotte Schachat, as well as to the artists and artworks (many now iconic) that passed through Die Kunskamer’s hands over the years.Image supplied: Welgemeend Art Month opens in AugustLouis, or “Oom Louis” as he was affectionately known, always emphasised that the decision to buy any artwork should be based on the buyer’s affection for a particular painting or sculpture, not on its perceived investment value.Works by, amongst others, Irma Stern, J. H. Pierneef, Alexis Preller, Deborah Poynton, Kenneth Bakker and many others, will be on display.Welgemeend Art Month 2022 will open on 5 August and closes on 31 August.
