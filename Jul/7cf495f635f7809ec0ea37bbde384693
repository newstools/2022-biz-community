At the end of the risk assessment, Deloitte prepared a report on the potential for money laundering through non-life insurance policies on behalf of SAIA, the FIA and SAUMA.Reserve Bank changes its stance on crypto regulationBy Katja Hamilton 15 Jul 2022“We asked Deloitte to work on a number of scenarios to establish the extent to which it may be possible to launder money through taking out a non-life insurance policy. The research confirmed that the risk of money laundering through non-life policies is exceptionally low,” said Ramagaga.Titled Risk Assessment of the Non-Life Insurance Sector to Financial Crime, the report was submitted to the FIC in December 2021.The FIC has now informed SAIA that, based on the findings of the risk assessment report, the FIC is of the opinion that, at this stage, there is no need to include the non-life insurance industry as accountable institutions under the FIC Act.However, the FIC indicated that it would continue to engage with the role-players in the industry to create awareness of current obligations, applicable to all businesses, relating to the reporting of suspicious and unusual transactions under section 29 of the FIC Act and complying with financial sanctions requirements in Part 2A of the FIC Act.The exemption means that the non-life insurance industry is not required to submit reports to the FIC on money laundering. However, they are still under obligation to report suspicious and unusual transactions activities to the FIC.Ramagaga said SAIA particularly appreciated the constructive approach that the FIC, Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA), the Prudential Authority (PA) and the National Treasury took in their participation throughout the risk assessment and reporting process.“SAIA will continue to offer its support and co-operation to the FIC, the FSCA and PA in terms of creating industry awareness of the broader requirements of the FIC Act,” said Ramagaga.
