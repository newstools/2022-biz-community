Ladles of Love's record-breaking historyThis is not Ladles of Love’s first attempt at a world record. The world record for the ‘longest line of food cans’ was smashed by more than double at the V&A Waterfront on 29 August 2021 with a 6.7km line of 94,560 food cans. The previous year the world record for the ‘most amount of sandwiches made in one hour’ was broken with 304,000 homemade sandwiches as compared to the previous record of 115,000. Every year all food raised is distributed to over 200 soup kitchens which collectively feed 30,000 people a day.To find out more about the campaign, go to www.ladlesoflove.org.za.
