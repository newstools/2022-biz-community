The musician’s sudden passing was confirmed to Sunday World by his sister Khululiwe Sithole. She said her brother was riding in an Uber with a friend when he started to complain about his struggle to breathe.Sithole said to Sunday World, “When I heard about my brother’s passing this morning, I was deeply heartbroken. The whole family is shuttered because it is not like he was sick, it was just a sudden thing.”“He was working on Sarafina just last week, and I have been thinking about his music, then he is suddenly not with us,” she continued."At the time of his death he had no place to stay and we either turned a blind eye or did not investigate enough how we could help him. I also tried as best as I could to help 1,000 but Mthandeni was mostly his own enemy." https://t.co/kbY5YbHq1x— TshisaLIVE (@TshisaLIVE) July 22, 2022Mvelase was behind the creation of some of the most sonic sounds in this country which include the music of Township Fever and Muvhango.
