Eksteen, CE of Stone, and former MD of South African Tourism (SAT) for the UK, Ireland, Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden region, based in London, says the quest for excellence, value impact, and unquestionable integrity should always be guiding principles in the Prism Awards when recognising the achievements in the industry.“The Awards must set a high benchmark to aspire to and should not be a mere confirmation of entry exercise. The Prism Awards provide a platform to contribute wider than our benefit. We must raise standards, empower the next generation of professionals, and continually add value to the society where we have the privilege to work,” says Eksteen.Renay Tandy, the co-founder of Ngage, was a first-time judge of the Awards this year and says it was a good experience to be on this side of the fence and to experience the process from start to finish.“Some of the entries this year showed exceptional creativity during a very challenging period which saw most companies cut marketing budgets and pull back because of the pandemic.”A handful of entries stood out for her. “The most important aspect for me was bringing the results back to business and to show how the campaigns made a difference. Lots of coverage and creativity is great, but it is the actual business results that make entries stand out for me.”See all the 2022 Prism Awards judges here.
