Ackermans Announced as Headline SponsorThe excitement and increased sense of prestige of the SA Parenting Blog Awards for 2022, which was recently backed by BabyYumYum.co.za, SA's #1 Parenting Portal, has been echoed with keen involvement from Ackermans making them the official headline partner for this year's awards.When asked why such a partnership ticked all the boxes for the Ackermans Chief of Marketing Merlin Norman, replied with the following insights;"As a trusted brand, loved by moms and valued all-round, we are confident that our full offering of quality products at unbeatable prices, not only adds value to our customers pocket, but to customers everyday lives. Partnering with the most informative and fastest growing mom and baby platform, will not only solidify our commitment to all those who take on the parenting role of Mzansi but also create a space for a more enhanced and collaborative experience, one that truly benefits these influential and special  individuals. We believe that partnering with BabyYumYum.co.za will help achieve this."The awards have been revived to make them more representative and relevant with a new identity and additional relevant categories being added.
