Sars will continue to pursue its mandate of collecting all revenue due, without fear, favour or prejudice.Sars Commissioner Edward Kieswetter commended Sars for acting swiftly to recover taxes that were due to the fiscus.He said, “any delay in acting with such speed would have seen the funds repatriated abroad, with little prospects of recovering the debt owed to Sars”.“Furthermore, this proves that Sars is on the right path to enhancing its ability and capability to deter non-compliant behaviour and the accompanying sense of impunity on the part of certain taxpayers. This is a major victory for the organisation and citizens of the country.”The Commissioner added that Sars is determined to work with other law enforcement agencies to follow up on the Zondo Commission’s recommendations in areas that fall within the legal framework that governs tax administration in the country.“This determination to work co-operatively with all relevant agencies reflects Sars’ commitment to spare no effort to hold those accountable for State Capture where tax crimes were committed,” he said.
