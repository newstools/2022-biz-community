Together, this reminds us that there is still so much on offer in our beautiful province, with its diversity of experiences being amongst the best in the world. I encourage South Africans, in particular, to get out and see the beauty our province has to offer."Valley of dreamsThe mayor of Stellenbosch Municipality, Gesie van Deventer, joined Wenger in welcoming the announcement. "It isn't difficult to see where Franschhoek gets its flair - from the majestic mountains surrounding the historic village to an endless array of activities, from internationally acclaimed wine farms to a wide array of local businesses."This gem of a town has cemented itself not only as one of South Africa's culinary capitals but also as a must-see for any local and international tourist. We are proud that Franschhoek has made this prestigious list and welcome all visitors to our valley with open arms. Their continued support sustains thousands of jobs,” said van Deventer.CEO of Franschhoek Tourism, Ruth McCourt adds: "We are immensely proud that our valley has been recognised (once again) as one of the "greatest places" in the world to visit. We continue to strive for and celebrate the diversity of our unique village that attracts both local and international visitors. And indeed, puts the whole of South Africa on the world tourism stage."Wenger concludes: "When I was sworn in as Provincial Minister of Finance and Economic Opportunities, I said that I was on the job for jobs. Leveraging our tourism and hospitality sector to do so is one of my priorities, and so, we will focus on removing the barriers that stand in the way of this sector, boost our destination marketing, and connect our region to more places around the world."
