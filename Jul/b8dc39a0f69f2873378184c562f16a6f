I was up on the surgery ward and it was nice to say hello. It's very easy to get bogged down with the rugby out here with high stakes and playing Test match rugby. It's nice to spend some downtime and get out to the community. Doing something like this today is very special.”Tour de Tuli takes a greener approach to cycling1 hour ago“Cape Town has been great. We have enjoyed everywhere so far, Johannesburg and Bloemfontein and to finish up here is perfect,” Rowlands continued.Jones added that touring is about integrating yourself into the society you are in. This is how you get a full appreciation for the country and how it functions.“We had an incredible welcome on the wards from the staff, children and their families and it was very humbling. Cape Town has been fantastic. We have had an amazing welcome throughout South Africa and the places we have been incredible,” Jones said.Bianca Buitendag joins Laureus Sport For Good17 Jun 2022CEO Chantel Cooper said, “Words cannot adequately describe the joy on the faces of children when they saw the coaches and players walk towards their bed, you could feel the excitement and awe in the air.”The staff were also delighted, and this was an amazing boost in morale for them.
