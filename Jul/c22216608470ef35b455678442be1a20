The solution is a recipe video teaching women to perform a self-exam and detect early signs of breast cancer.The video showed a traditional Lebanese baker demonstrating the steps of a breast self-exam through a similar gesture: the act of kneading and pressing dough. The gestures transformed an intimate and taboo subject into an acceptable, everyday experience.“We’re honoured and humbled by the recognition and even though the results are overwhelming we still have a long way to go for awareness in women’s health. Excited to see what creativity can do to help various diverse communities,” said Mateo Fernandez, executive creative director, McCann Paris2022 Grand AwardsActivation and Engagement:  McCann Paris “The Bread Exam” Spinneys Supermarket - Lebanese Breast Cancer Foundation - AUBMC HospitalAvant-Garde/Innovative:  Serviceplan Germany “Dot Pad.
