And right up front, I have to mention that the fuel consumption in the diesel derivative was incredible, especially in these times when the price of fuel is rising continually. The C Class of old was often referred to as the ‘baby Merc’. Not anymore. The ‘baby’ has finally grown up. Slightly longer, higher and wider than its predecessors. A new kind of comfort and besides the sleek styling, the attention grabber inside was the large central display screen that controls virtually everything with the C Class. A remarkable user experience.  Right here right nowThe new C-Class is manufactured in Mercedes-Benz Cars production plants in Bremen, Beijing, and right here in East London. R13bn has already been invested in numerous upgrades at the East London plant in preparation for the production of the new model, providing a major boost to the local automotive industry. Mark Raine, President of Mercedes-Benz Cars and Co-CEO of Mercedes-Benz South Africa says the fact that East London is one of three global manufacturing plants for the new C-Class is an unparalleled success story for the local industry.Sporty and elegantThe new C-Class already looks to be in motion at a standstill with its dynamic proportions, thanks to the combination of short front overhang, long wheelbase, and rear overhang.
