Special consideration is given to small businesses who meet these criteria and are female owned and operated.What is an ICT-based business?A good way to think about ICT is to consider all uses of digital technology that exist to help individuals, businesses and organisations with the use of information. ICT covers any product that will store, retrieve, manipulate, transmit or receive information electronically in a digital form. For example, computers, digital broadcast, email, robotics, cloud computing, hosting, fibre installation, networking, enterprise architecture, hardware support, AR, VR, software and application development. An ICT business may do work in a number of different industries including but not limited to education, finance, marketing, procurement, manufacturing, sanitation, health, medical, supply chain, construction, media, telecommunications, and technology.Criteria for admissionApplying businesses must be:a company defined in South Africa as an SMME, QSE or EME,operational and trading for 2 or more years,at least 51% black owned,a minimum Level 1–4 BBBEE status according to the DTI or ICT codes,a registered company with key focus in ICT,latest annual financial statements,companies with the potential, vision and desire to grow.Benefits of the Enterprise Development incubation programme:Business skills training and development for small business ownersTargeted technical and infrastructure support Compliance assistanceMarketing and PR assistance2-year intensive mentorship programme with incubator partnersAccess to grant funding and business resource support Access to ICT networks, events and conferencesValue and sustainability growth partnership (no equity dilution) Applications open from 1 July 2022 and close mid-November 2022.
