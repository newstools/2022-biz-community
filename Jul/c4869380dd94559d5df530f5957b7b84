In 2021, the restaurant scored 80th place. Run by chef James Gaag, this minimalist restaurant is nestled on the slopes of the Cape Peninsula. A treehouse-like setting with a large glass ceiling that allows for light to come in, La Colombe provides a food experience that is theatrical. The venue also has an iconic sister location, La Petite Colombe, in Franschoek. “Thank you, not only to the judges, but to every diner who has visited and supported us over the past year – we’ll be raising a glass to all of you this evening!” said La Colombe after winning 56th place.
