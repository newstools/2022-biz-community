The station was awarded a Gold Prism award for Digital Media Relations and a Bronze Prism award in the Gaming & Virtual Reality category – a first for radio in Africa.“We focused on giving our community an experience they could appreciate and I think this led to our results and awards. Mzansi Quest was brave and innovative, the game attracted over 10,000 players over a week, and elevated the broadcast sector by showcasing the use of innovative technologies in tandem with the marketing mix to promote a campaign,” said Leith Smith, marketing manager at Jacaranda FM.For the Spar Carols by Candlelight campaign, Jacaranda FM won Gold as a Corporate Citizen after raising over R250,000 for Mzansi’s most vulnerable over the festive season, and giving local talent and musicians the chance to earn money when the events industry was crippled. Jacaranda FM also won a Silver Prism award for Digital Media Relations in this category.Elana Afrika-Bredenkamp, host of Jacaranda FM’s Workzone bagged the Bronze Presidential Award for Radio Presenter of the Year.“We love the culture of excellence our entire team brings to the table, and Elana is no exception. Her consummate professionalism and relatability has made her a standout broadcaster, and we are thrilled to see her honoured by the Public Relations Institute of Southern Africa,” says Smith.
