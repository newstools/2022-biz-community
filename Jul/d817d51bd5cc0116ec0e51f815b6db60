On 30 June 2022, the Mail & Guardian unveiled the annual 200 Young South Africans eminent list of exemplary young individuals committed to creating an inclusive, equal and sustainable future for our great nation. This elegant event was hosted at the John Kani auditorium at the iconic Market Theatre in Newtown, Johannesburg, one of South Africa’s centres of excellence in the performing arts. As the 200 YSA winners, sponsors, partners and enthusiasts converged to enjoy a night of inspiration and entertainment, it is important to note that it was the first in-person event after two years of a socially-distanced way of life as the world continues to grapple with the Covid-19 pandemic. This star-studded event was graced by the executive mayor of Johannesburg, Cllr Mpho Phalatse, alongside representatives from our esteemed sponsors and event partners. The evening’s programme included brilliant performances by spoken word artist Vuyelwa Maluleke, legendary comedians Loyiso Gola and Kagiso Lediga and culminated in an electrifying performance by award-winning singer-songwriter Ami Faku.As we bask in the joy of celebrating our 200 Young winners, we would like to congratulate all involved in this prestigious project. It was an arduous task selecting this year’s list from the over 3000 nominations we received, and a glowing testament to South Africa’s vast potential for a skilled and talented workforce set to transition and upskill our country to the next frontier.
