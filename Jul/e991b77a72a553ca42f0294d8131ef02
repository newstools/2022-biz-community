Despite the challenges brought on by the adverse circumstances under lockdown, which undoubtedly made learning difficult, these young individuals chose to remain committed and never gave up.Launched in 2017, in partnership with Vodacom, Yep was initiated to lend a helping hand to unemployed South African youth, ushering young entrepreneurial minds on a guided tour of the modern business environment, developing skills necessary for the working world and exposing them to the opportunities that exist within the realm of tech entrepreneurship.The Youth Entrepreneurship Programme gave beneficiaries an ideal and holistic tool-kit for the modern day, young entrepreneur to dig their roots deep and build a solid foundation for their businesses to develop.

It is a victory over impending doom, failure and challenges, a victory over mediocrity, the comfort zone and complacency, and it is a victory over every bit of fear that’s ever stopped you from achieving your goals and getting where you want to be in life,” said Jooste.Congratulations to each of our Yep Class of 2021!Free State:Bonolo SebitsangElizabeth Dimakatso LiketsoFundiswa TotolaItumeleng MokolokoJackson MolapisiKeabetswe MonganaLebogang MokolokoLehlohonolo MajawetsaNkagiseng MponyaOlebogeng PossPulane PhianeRefentse PhiriGauteng & Mpumalanga:Ben MagagulaBilly MagagulaBrightness MalatjiFrancis Mmampa RapakgadiGracca Khensani MahomaneHarry RamokgopaJerodine ModauKgopotso MashakuLebogang LetsatsiMatlhatsi MalebyeMartha MaupaMiranda MogaleMmalerato MokwenaMogau Rudolph MatlalaPromise MethulaWestern Cape:Anele MgabaCassidy BennettKaede CupidoKerwin FlintMatthew DavidsNazneen JacobsNokubonga NgcebaShikalepo YekaniSiyavuya NdleleniThandokazi Dyantyi
