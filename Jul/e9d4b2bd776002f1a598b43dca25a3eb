For example, ‘metaverse’ is the buzzword of the moment after several requests from agencies we launched this new category by popular demand.”In another sign of the times, the Covid-19 Communications category has been dropped. Work related to the pandemic will still have a home in Epica’s existing Public Interest: Health category.The Full Circle 2022: You Cannes not miss this2 days agoWith the tragic conflict continuing in Ukraine, the Epica Awards will not be accepting entries from Russian agencies.
