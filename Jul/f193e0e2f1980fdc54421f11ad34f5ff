His influence, value and presence are immense as he leads a large, centrally-controlled marketing team in a giant organisation, where each division is a business on its own that competes against other established companies in highly-traded sectors," Mattheus explains."As an exco member, he does justice to the profession in all its aspects, from his digital-first view to the detailed customer understanding he employs across all channels, creating shared value, promoting diversity, and building the brand and culture while showing excellent business results,” adds Mattheus.The Marketing Organisation of the Year AwardThis Award celebrates the organisation that has most clearly demonstrated how its business, brand and marketing strategy are closely aligned and executed to drive sustained returns.Haydn Townsend, MAA council member and an MD at Accenture Song – sponsor of the MAA Marketing Organisation of the Year Award – says entrants had to show how their marketing initiatives had related to sustained performance towards the triple bottom line over a three-year period.“This is one of the industry’s most meaningful awards because it interrogates companies from a holistic perspective. It delves into what it takes to be an organisation that embraces the entire brand experience and remains relevant doing it."This award is not only important for the recognition it bestows on the winner – in this case, The Discovery Group but, as an example of best practice, also a future learning tool from which the whole industry can benefit,” says Townsend.(Supplied) Jared Patel, head of marketing at Sea Harvest Group, winner of the MAA 2022 Rising Star of the Year AwardRising Star of the Year AwardThis year’s Rising Star of the Year Award, sponsored by Mondelēz Africa, celebrates the best young marketer under the age of 35 who showed their potential to become an outstanding industry leader, through impactful, analytical and creative marketing efforts.Thembi Butelezi, equity and marketing strategy lead at Mondelēz Sub-Saharan Africa, emphasises the importance of young marketers being able to leverage a balanced skill set, especially in a volatile operating climate.“The current business and marketing landscape is constantly evolving.
