Nevertheless, the lack of visibility of women and people of colour in the gaming and esports industry means that fewer people from these groups can imagine taking up gaming as a hobby, not even speaking about making a career of it.Therefore, #EveryGamerCounts aims to champion inclusivity and representation in gaming. A specific focus lies on raising awareness of the obstacles faced by women, minorities, and people with disabilities in esports and gaming.Mettlestate announces the Intel Africa MastersIssued by  Mettlestate 25 Jul 2022“Diversity is a critical questioning of representation and access is an important topic in our work,” says Nesa Fröhlich, regional head of information at the Goethe-Institut South Africa. “By bringing together experts from all over the world for panel discussions and Game Jams, we hope to connect the conversation in South Africa to the global discourse and stimulate debate and change in the local gaming scene.”The programme#EveryGamerCounts will take place during the months of August and September 2022 with Game Jams in townships around Gauteng, alongside online panel discussions culminating in a final Game Jam at the Goethe-Institut Johannesburg premises.In conjunction with Women’s Month, the project aims to help to champion inclusivity and representation in gaming: Raising awareness of the obstacles faced by women, minorities, and people with disabilities in the esports and gaming industry.
