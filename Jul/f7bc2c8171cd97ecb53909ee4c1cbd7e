At this stage, it is imperative that organisations understand the implications of their personal information practices and put in place systems and measures to manage both their existing and ongoing obligations. What has happened since PoPIA came into effect?In order to address compliance with PoPIA, your organisation has most likely had to: Undertake exercises in training staff to comply with PoPIA across all operations;  Conduct personal information impact assessments to address areas of non-compliance;  Address issues relating to the consent, transfer and sharing of personal information with third parties (ie. suppliers, customers, etc); and Navigate the intricacies of dealing with incidents of data breaches. Compliance with PoPIA has in certain circumstances necessitated a fundamental shift in the manner in which businesses approach various aspects of their operations. With this shift has come various challenges in accommodating such a transition.Examples include: There has been a slow uptake in the registration of Information Officers; Many organisations are yet to put in place or update their existing Promotion of Access to Information Manual (PAIA Manual) as required; and  There are still issues in the interpretation of certain provisions of PoPIA which remain uncharted territory and must be navigated through the use of the appropriate processes and legal mechanisms.Over the past year, developments in case law relating to data privacy have aided us in better understanding the compliance requirements set out in PoPIA. However, this understanding must be accompanied by practical guidelines to assist organisations in the development and implementation of compliance programmes that take into account their specific needs and operational parameters.PoPIA: Can businesses ask for vaccine status information?By Preeta Bhagattjee, Aphindile Govuza and Reece Westcott 9 Mar 2022How to ensure your complianceTo address any potential compliance gaps within your business, a number of fundamental steps should be considered and taken.
