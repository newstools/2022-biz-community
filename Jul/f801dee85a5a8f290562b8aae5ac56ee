Working in close collaboration, the Hollard and Flow Communications teams devised a five-week challenge that used gamification and prizes to motivate Hollardites (Hollard employees) to deepen their understanding of the insurance giant’s purpose of enabling more people to “create and secure a better future”.“Employee experience is actually what makes corporate engines turn and what makes companies great. To be involved in a project that had such a positive impact on Hollardites’ engagement and fulfilment levels, and working with the wonderful team at Flow, was an awesome experience. It's great to make a difference by doing things differently,” says Warwick Bloom, head of public relations and internal marketing at the Hollard Group.Tiffany Turkington-Palmer, managing director at Flow Communications, says: “I am so proud to work with Hollard, who do amazing work in internal communications and are always up for a challenge; they are always game for innovative ideas and implementing these. I truly value our long-standing partnership.“At Flow Communications we believe in working with people we like, on work we love, and on work that will make the world a better place. Winning this award is testament to the continued good work that we do in partnership with Hollard – collaborating to create mutually beneficial outcomes.“Flow’s vision is to be the company of choice for quality clients and to deliver the best integrated communications solutions possible. This accolade shows that our work meets this vision, and our mission to build long-term, value-adding relationships with our clients – partnerships that are based on their business strategies, imperatives and needs.”To execute the #DoItOnPurpose campaign – a digital game that encouraged Hollard staff to engage with the company purpose, as well as their own, personal raison d’être – Flow built a digital bot that guided Hollardites through five levels of a challenge the company set for them, related to five goals that underpin Hollard’s greater purpose.Richard Frank, chief technology officer at Flow Communications, says that the bot, while “definitely not sentient, did deliver a punch and an innovative channel for communicating to Hollardites during a particularly difficult Covid-19 lockdown period.“What was inspiring was how game Hollardites were in participating, sharing and collaborating in a wholly virtual space.”The Marketing Achievement Awards celebrate the impact that strategic marketing can make in business.
