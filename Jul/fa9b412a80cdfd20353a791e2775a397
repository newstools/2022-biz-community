A promising career gone too soon.”Mbatha’s killing underlines the high levels of deadly crimes that South Africans are subjected to on a daily basis.

It has to stop.”Alex FM was one of the stations that were looted during last year’s unrest in July. Following the looting, the station remained on the air despite the challenges.
