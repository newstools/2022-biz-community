One such use case is where Pizza Hut generated 900 million impressions of surprise and delight and collaborated with Pac-Man to re-introduce the popular game directly on top of the pizza box packaging. Another great use case is the release of Jumanji: The Next Level WebAR. The creators used Amazon voice services where consumers can talk to the experience and activate the WebAR app. Video Credit: Trigger - The XR AgencyFamiliar metricsWebAR comes with familiar metrics of success and brand marketers can see data all the way through the funnel: Impressions / Brand liftCTREngagementConversionsCart Size & revenueOne great way to get started is with the low-code/ no-code AR platforms that are available, such as Zappar’s Designer tool, for which they’ve won an award for Best Creator & Authoring tool.
