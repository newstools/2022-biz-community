The main part of the contract though is the demolition of the two silo structures for which preparatory work is currently underway. “Remedial or rehabilitation work in the mining industry presents a major opportunity for Phoenecian,” comments Khanyile. Mine sites must be brought back to the condition of grazing land which involves soil testing and removing any concrete foundations, sometimes up to a depth of 1.5m.Source: SuppliedProtecting surrounding structuresPhoenecian demolition expert Richard Kelly explains that the challenge associated with any demolition work is to protect surrounding structures from damage. “It is especially important when it comes to mine infrastructure like silos and headgear.” Phoenecian has deployed a cherry picker to clear a safe working zone around the two silos. This will be followed by drilling blastholes for the explosives and their charging.
