Adam Howard explains: “I loved that Karien rehearsed and filmed each commercial in just one continuous shot. I decided that the music needed to accompany the picture and played in one take – live – with no edits. I played around with different emotive piano themes but it was the very first idea I laid down that became the soundtrack for the campaign. Spontaneity was the true inspiration.” All audio post and final mix were also crafted at Howard Audio.
