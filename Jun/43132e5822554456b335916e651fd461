It’s also a creative new vehicle to engage the community, and a way to offer exclusive perks to creatives around the world.”The One Club will mint the utility NFTs on the VAST platform, which is powered by Polygon, an eco-friendly Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol and a framework for building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks using smart contracts.
