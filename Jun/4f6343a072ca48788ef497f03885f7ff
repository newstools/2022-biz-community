This means there were about 370,000 more people employed in Q1:2022 than in Q4:2021. Is this trend mirrored in the local job market? The latest data reveals that there was a (seasonally adjusted) 4% increase in average vacancies per month between the final quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022. There was a further increase in job opportunities in April and May. The monthly average of vacancies has increased by 8% since the fourth quarter of 2021.

Just over 30% of job offers are located in the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). International work opportunities are currently scarce, with job offers at 3%. Gauteng, the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal all show an increased demand for professionals in design, media and arts and architecture and engineering as well as the legal sectors over the last two years. The Western Cape experienced a decrease in hiring activity for design, media and arts professionals between 2020 and 2021. Similar trends were evident for architecture and engineering professionals in the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal between 2020 and 2021. Overall, however, recruitment activity has grown significantly across all three professional sectors over the last 12 months. Impact of Covid-19 According to Stats SA’s latest Quarterly Labour Force Survey, of the 40 million working age population in Q1:2022, more than half (51.6%) were youth. Individuals in the 15-24 age bracket and 25-34 age bracket experienced the highest unemployment rates of 63.9% and 42.1% respectively. The country’s youth experienced many of the job losses that occurred during pandemic. This could be partly attributed to the fact that when it comes to job cuts, the “last one in” is often “the first one out”. Younger employees with less experience and fewer years of service face a greater risk in this regard. Another reason for the high youth unemployment figures during Covid-19 could be attributed to the impact of the lockdowns on the hospitality and entertainment sectors, which directly affected ‘younger’ jobs like waitering or bartending. The negative impact of Covid-19 on youth employment is not only a South African trend. According to the International Labour Organisation, youth employment dropped by 8.7% globally in 2020. For older individuals, the decline in employment was less severe, registering at 3.7%. This difference shows the extent of Covid-19’s impact on younger people. Looking at job market movement during South Africa’s national Covid-19 lockdowns between Q2:2020 and Q1:2021, over 63% of job leavers were below the age of 35 years. Were certain sectors and job roles more affected than others by the ‘leaving trend’ during the Covid-19 lockdowns? The sectors with the highest number of job leavers (ages 15-34) between Q2:2020 and Q1:2021 were as follows: - Admin, office and support- Sales - Business and management - Finance - Education, training and library - Information technology - Manufacturing and assembly - Warehousing and logistics - Building and construction - Marketing - Cleaning, maintenance and repair The job roles with the highest number of youth job leavers (ages 15-34) within the admin, office and support sector during this period were admin clerks, client and customer support roles, and tellers and cashiers. Sales experienced the highest number of youth job leavers during the same period for representative/sales consulting roles.
