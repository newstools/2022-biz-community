Still, for our small engineering training company in Johannesburg South Africa, the Panama Project was our largest export order in many years and the first time we ever supplied equipment to that particular region. And the Panama Papers were our technical documents converting our Pert standard line to the required 110v local power (the voltage wasn’t a problem, it was the extra 10hz of frequency that caused the real headache).Below are some pictures. We supplied a variety of  training equipment, electrical, mechanical and chemical engineering. Developing economies share challenges and opportunities and we feel our South African company has something distinctive to offer. We have been manufacturing technical training equipment since 1967.
