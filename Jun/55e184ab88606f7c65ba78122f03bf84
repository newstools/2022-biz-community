Another 37% report that their agency is more “average” while 21% responded that their agency is below average or doing poorly. Fewer than half of all agencies (48%) actively track progress of their corporate responsibility progress and just over one-third (36%) have a team dedicated to corporate responsibility.Walk the talk"We believe ad agencies are key players in driving the Corporate Responsibility agenda and getting the industry to walk the talk in sustainability is essential,” says Isa Kurata, co-founder of ACT Responsible, an international non-profit organisation.“The findings show that while the topic is important to agencies, it’s critical that they measure their progress to showcase the excellent work they’re doing,” adds Kurata. “This research is intended to help agencies and advertisers recognise and engage with the world in a positive, responsible way,” says Cathy Heeley, international media analytics lead, Nielsen. “These insights are important for those seeking to improve their corporate social responsibility, or further continue their already strong efforts,” she states.
