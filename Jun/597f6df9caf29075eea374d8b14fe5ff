"We are already supporting more than 73,000 students from early childhood development centres, primary schools and secondary schools, with more children to benefit in Phase 2 of the programme. To achieve our livelihood target we plan to provide mentorship, capacity building, skills development and access to finance to small businesses in the mining value chain and in other sectors, with a focus on women and young people. Since 2018, we have supported over 13,500 jobs and facilitated R430m of loans to small businesses in South Africa through Anglo American’s Zimele Loan Fund.” Business can reconnect with its purpose as pandemic restrictions easeIssued by  Trialogue 21 Apr 2022Anglo American has committed to contributing additional funds to agreed social causes if it falls short of fully achieving its education and livelihood targets under the terms of the IFC loan.
