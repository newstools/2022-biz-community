It will provide a coordination framework for all key ecosystem role players in small enterprise development. It guides the coordinating mechanism that will guide all programmes that support small enterprises. The Nised is the product of a wide consultation with the relevant departments in the national, provincial and local spheres of government, business, labour, academics and various relevant institutions.Published on 10 May on the government notices by the Minister, members of the public can send their comments to az.vog.dbsd@mdesin or submit by hand to the Policy Unit, Department of Small Business Development, 77 Meintjies Street, Sunnyside, Pretoria, within 30 days of the publication of the notice.The abridged version of the Nised Masterplan is accessible on the Department of Small Business Development website and the full version is published in the gazette for public comment.
