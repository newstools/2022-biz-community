One thing the project team could not have foreseen was the need to fast track the completion of the facility, to keep stores stocked following the events in July 2021. “I must acknowledge the way our partners on the project, R&L Architects and EDS Engineers and our landlords, Century properties have supported us throughout, and particularly when the timeline was brought forward by 5 months,” he added.Takealot's new Richmond Park pickup point comes with robot helpers5 May 2022The company said that as sustainability is a priority in any Massmart facility, the Riversands campus makes maximum use of natural light, energy saving LED lights with motion sensors, and uses borehole water for its wash bays and reserve water tanks. In addition to this, throughout the construction process, the wetlands next to the DC have been preserved in order to support healthy ecosystem functioning and provide a refuge for resident flora and fauna.“Every element of this distribution centre is geared towards improving efficiency. From reducing our own energy usage to the operational efficiency of the high volume product focus, Riversands will play an important role in getting the right products onto our shelves at the best possible price for customers,” concluded Molapo.
