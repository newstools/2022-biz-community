She narrated the use of the Basotho blanket as a transformative and imaginative symbol of identity and relevance”.Said Sephelane: “The opportunity afforded to me has validated a lot of what my fellow students, especially people who connect with their culture, have been struggling with, and that is the issue of translating who they are and what their culture entails and the values they bring to their everyday lives and professions.“The journey is really a beginning for me as I am excited to continue to collaborate and learn from other cultures about such ideas of translation and preservation.”Burkina Faso's award-winning architect returns home a heroBy Thiam Ndiaga and Anne Mimault 6 Jun 2022The seven regional winners presented their theses to an esteemed panel of judges in a Johannesburg studio during May, from where the final winner was selected.
