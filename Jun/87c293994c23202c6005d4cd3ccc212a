In addition, limits imposed on the capacity at venues for gatherings have been lifted, notably checks for Covid-19 symptoms, vaccination status or PCR test results are no longer necessary upon entry to venues or at border crossings. While the Code of practice: Managing exposure to SARS-COV-2 in the workplace still prevails in the work environment (and which requires an approach informed by risk assessment and does not mandate mask wearing), public life may be closer to pre-Covid-19 normalcy.
