All digital tactics we implement are data driven, from the social listening we do and insights derived across all platforms,” comments Muhle Ndwalane, managing director of Asante Solutions. The company executed a brief from UKZN’s corporate relations division, the brains behind the UKZN graduation media and communications strategy. This innovative strategy has  seen UKZN graduation ceremonies dominating mainstream and social media space over the past couple of years“Integrating with the UKZN corporate relations division team is an amazing experience as we are able to work in harmony and seamlessly achieve multiple goals that increase the UKZN brand value. The success of the #UKZNGrad2022 is a testament to that, as we were able to instil pride on all stakeholders and increase the number of prospective students.”Through the execution of  the humancentric and authentic marketing strategy adopted by UKZN, Asante Solutions contributed to putting  the UKZN brand on the map by highlighting touching celebratory moments of students and parents, jubilations and ululations that saw the UKZN hashtag #UKZNGrad2022 topping the Twitter trends list in first place for three consecutive days with over 12 million impressions, and having other social media accounts (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Tik Tok) reaching millions of people. The UKZN TikTok account in particular was opened on 4 May, the first day of the graduation, and has now gained more than 52,000 followers and over three million views in less than a month due to the authentic content that has been developed during the graduation season.A proud and emotional parent singing from the heart.
