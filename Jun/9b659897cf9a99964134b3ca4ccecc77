We believe in South African agriculture and winning best beer in Africa with a beer that’s brewed with 100% local ingredients is a testament to that.”Live Culture Grand Cru is a barrel-aged farmhouse ale fermented with wild yeast native to the Simondium-based brewery. It was brewed with barley from Caledon alongside citrus fynbos and hops grown in Soul Barrel’s beer garden. Africa's oldest brew and a companion of many celebrationsBy Millicent Maroga, Issued by  Heineken South Africa 25 May 2022International judgesThis was the third year of the competition and the first time that international judges were invited to join. Judges from 16 different countries evaluated the 251 entries over three days last week. The winners were announced in May at an awards evening held at Jack Black’s Brewing Company in Cape Town.“We want to elevate the competition to be in line with other international competitions,” says African Beer Cup founder Lucy Corne. “And inviting extremely experienced, highly respected beer industry experts from around the world is crucial for our competition. It’s the first time any beer competition in Africa has welcomed such highly esteemed judges.” The judges awarded 10 gold medals, 29 silver medals and 27 bronze medals across 32 categories. The competition is judged to the Beer Judge Certification Program (BJCP) guidelines, which focus on stylistic accuracy rather than personal preference. Beers must reach a certain score threshold in order to be considered for a medal, with a maximum of one gold, one silver and one bronze per category.The 10 gold medallists then went head to head in a Best of Show round to determine the Best Beer in Africa. Rather than a trophy, the winner receives a custom painting to celebrate their win.

The Basa African Celebration Award, sponsored by the Beer Association of South Africa (Basa), was awarded to Botswana’s Okavango Craft Brewery for its Old Bull Stout, which uses locally grown millet alongside malted barley. The brewery is spearheading a programme that supports local farmers and buys surplus millet, which is then malted at the brewery and used across their beer range.

The silver medal was awarded to Heineken for Heineken 0.0, while the bronze went to Signal Hill Products for Devil's Peak To The Sea Non-Alc IPA. “Basa believes that non-alcoholic beers are a critical step towards differentiating beer as the drink of choice for all occasions,” says Pillay.All the winnersBasa African Celebration AwardOkavango Craft Brewery -
