Image supplied: Oscar Murillo, surge (social cataracts)Taking the stories and histories of the Indian Ocean as its departure point, the project, including the exhibition, brings together contemporary artists, filmmakers, musicians, writers and thinkers to investigate, unpack and shed light on some of the smaller and bigger historical, cultural and linguistic links between the continents of Africa and Asia. The exhibition approaches the Indian Ocean as a communal horizon from which to read Afrasian histories of forced and unforced movement through currents of mercantile and colonial empire.Soh Bejeng Ndikung and Ginwala said, “What does oceanic re-memory look like? How does one correspond with and commemorate this terrain that is equally one of connection as it is of indenture and trauma? As we transmit the complex knowledge that is harboured within many of us as water beings, Indigo Waves and Other Stories seeks to set up reciprocal motions that unsettle established geopolitical assessments and the dominance in academia around the North Atlantic. It is our intention with this project to attend to open tides of acculturation, Afrasian imaginaries, an atmosphere of multiple tongues and the monsoon cycles of the Indian Ocean system.”Mary Sibande opens art exhibition in Durban1 Jun 2022Indigo Waves and Other Stories includes ambitious new commissions from South African multidisciplinary artist Thania Petersen, visual artist Ayesha Hameed, the Réunionnais sculptor Hasawa, Franco-Comorian Myriam Omar Awadi and Mauritian artist Shiraz Bayjoo’s site-specific installation, made in collaboration with local historian and storyteller Traci Kwaai.

We are showing that our voices and narratives carry the beauty of our entanglements and relationships over centuries, and now is the time that it takes centre stage.”Indigo Waves and Other Stories opens on 30 June 2022 and will be on view until 29 January 2023 on level 2 at Zeitz Mocaa.
