We expect a mild contraction of between 3-5% year-on-year in 2022. This will mainly be on the back of a decline in some field crop harvests, combined with the base effects after two years of solid growth where the sector expanded by 14,9% year-on-year in 2020 and 8,8% year-on-year in 2021 (revised figures). By field crops, we are not only referring to summer grains but also sugar cane, which experienced sizable damage from the recent heavy floods in KwaZulu-Natal. This impact will likely show in the second quarter data. Moreover, the livestock subsector, which accounts for a substantial share of the South African agricultural value-added, also faces numerous challenges this year, such as rising feed costs and the outbreaks of foot-and-mouth, which has led to an export ban to various markets.  Overall, while we are downbeat about South Africa's agriculture growth prospects this year, this sector still has potential for growth in the coming years. Notably, this year's possible underperformance does not mean that the sector is in bad shape per se; the output in a range of commodities is well above the long-term levels, which speaks to the exceptional performance of the past two years rather than the current production conditions. South African farming: New policy offers promise, but there's fixing to be done tooBy Wandile Sihlobo 21 Jan 2022From a policy position, the sector's recently launched an Agriculture and Agro-processing Master Plan to drive long-term inclusive growth and help unlock barriers that currently constrain performance. Some of the barriers require collaboration with the line departments, specifically the need to boost the efficiency of municipalities and the much-needed network industries, mainly the roads, rail, ports, water, and electricity.
