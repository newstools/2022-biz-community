More than 500 entrepreneurs, marketers, academics and celebrities gathered at The Capital On the Park hotel in Sandton to celebrate and support South African youth-owned brands.  “Any nation that doesn’t invest in its own youth is sabotaging its future. As Sakhumnotho Group Holdings, young people are at the heart of what we do. With a staff complement that averages the age of 34, we’re the true definition of an organisation that believes in young leadership. Having been the naming sponsor for the Top 16 Youth Owned Brands Awards has been a reflection of what we stand for as a world-class Pan-African investment holdings company,” says Mosa Ntwampe, Group head of marketing and corporate communication at Sakhumnotho Group Holdings (SGH). #YouthMonth: Meet the young legal tech whizz being honoured by the American Bar AssociationBy Imran Salie 15 Jun 2022The awards were developed by Pat on Brands in partnership with SGH, to recognise and further empower South African brands that are owned and run by the youth between the ages of 18 –35 - to also shine a spotlight on their impact and extraordinary contribution to the country's GDP.
