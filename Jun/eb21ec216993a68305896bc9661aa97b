She reached the pinnacle of success in surfing despite facing many personal and professional challenges, yet never lost focus of her calling to give back to the community and make a difference in the lives of orphaned and vulnerable children. She really is an example to us all, and I am humbled to welcome a woman of her calibre to the Laureus family.” The Ballito Pro hosts World Surf League and Challenger Series10 Jun 2022Laureus SA has been based at the Stellenbosch Academy of Sport since January this year and works closely with the Academy in an aim to empower and uplift the community through sporting programmes.
