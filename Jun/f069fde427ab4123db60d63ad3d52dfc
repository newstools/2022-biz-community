“We are of the view that skilled, capable youth are the foundation for our sustained success. Corporate South Africa must step up its efforts to partner with government to address the current crisis where the country’s youth unemployment is over 65%. We need young talent to rebuild this country, said SRSA’s CEO, Lubin Ozoux.He added, “At SRSA, we are committed to taking tyre manufacturing to the next level so that we continue to evolve and grow. We believe that creating opportunities for youth at all levels, in all facets of our business, keeps us in tune with a new generation and injects fresh ideas and energy into our business.” “Since 2014, SRSA has run 400 tyre learnerships at the Ladysmith plant for unemployed youth aged 18 to 34, providing them with an NQF Level 3 certificate in one of three qualifications: Tyre and Tyre Components, Tyre Assembly and Quality Checking of Tyres. All qualifications are accredited with merSETA. Each qualification includes induction, six to eight weeks of classroom training followed by practical training in the plant,” explained Yolandi van Wyk, director: HR and employee relations, adding that SRSA had taken on two cohorts of 20 learners each this year, one of which started in February and the second in April.“Looking at our graduate programme, we have now taken a careful look at our business to identify suitable projects across the business that can provide young graduates with relevant experience and add vibrancy to the industry. Eighteen graduates – seven at our Durban head office, 10 at our Ladysmith factory and one for our Young Potentials programme – have been selected for the 2022 Graduate and Young Potentials Programme. This will open the door for graduates looking to enter the automotive industry through a structured year-long development programme, helping to upskill young potentials and jump-start their careers,” added Van Wyk.  SRSA is a division of Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd (SRI), one of the leading premium manufacturers of automotive tyres and industrial rubber products in the world, headquartered in Japan.Van Wyk believes the opportunity to work for a global organisation through this programme promises graduates a high-tech work environment where the spotlight is on delivering the quality and service, demanded by a leading international company.  “At SRSA, we are focused on innovation, sales and customer service and intent on disrupting the current tyre industry by bringing real value through efficiency and technological innovation.  The projects selected for this programme aim to have a meaningful impact on our business and will be invaluable in equipping graduates for the next step in their career journey, which could include joining our talent pool or taking up other opportunities within the automotive sector, which has a huge impact on the economy at large,” she said.Application process for graduate programmeTo apply, graduates must have a primary degree in the required field for a project on the list.
