Award winners, adjudicators, and Corobrik and SAIA officials at the 2019-2020 Corobrik-SAIA Awards of Merit and Awards for ExcellenceThe SAIA awards programme is structured over a two-year period and is conducted in two stages. Stage 1 sees regional awards for architecture presented by the various regional institutes affiliated to SAIA. In Stage 2, the national awards, the winning regional projects receive either a commendation, an award of merit and/or an award for excellence. This follows a vigorous adjudication and shortlisting process. TUCT's Mpho Sephelane named national winner of the 35th Corobrik Student Architecture Awards10 Jun 2022The national group of adjudicators is independent of the regional awards process and is selected by the SAIA president in their capacity as convenor. “This honour passed to me for the 2019-2020 cycle, which has been somewhat delayed, having taken place through a period of immense difficulty. The adjudication has had to navigate a series of national lockdowns and immeasurable personal and collective loss as a result of Covid-19. As we cautiously emerge into a post-pandemic world, this is a moment which requires pause and reflection – for the space the awards hold, and how SAIA as an institution might face and contend with the future,” says SAIA past president and Corobrik-SAIA Awards convenor Kate Otten.Panel of judgesWolff Architects won one award of merit and two awards for excellence.The panel of judges for the 2019-2020 Corobrik-SAIA Awards of Merit and Awards for Excellence were:Musa Shangase, commercial director: Corobrik; Boni Makwe, a practicing architect and director at studioMAS Architects & Urban Designers; Dr Huda Tayob, an architect, senior lecturer, and architectural historian; Muhammad Mayet, a practising architect, urban designer, and principal director of Mayet Architects; and Yewande Omotoso, an architect and award-winning novelist and writer.The judging panel viewed a collection of 68 built works and three written works submitted to the final stage.
