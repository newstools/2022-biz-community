But through this programme, he will share the knowledge he has gathered over the years and help set up the candidates to make the most of their careers. Over the years, Lange has helped bring new light to the industry through the work that he and his team produce at Paarl-based LA Customs. More recently though, Lange partnered with famed workwear brand Sweet-Orr in their #LoveWhatYouDo campaign. As part of a larger video series, Lange takes Sweet-Orr on a journey through his process and shares his philosophy on work, mentorship and what inspires him most.
