Kia’s modernised ‘tiger nose’ grille affords substantial width to the face and artfully integrates high-tech LED headlamps.Image credit: Naresh MaharajImage credit: Naresh MaharajDramatic bonnet lines enhance the vehicle’s unmistakably eye-catching character, while brawny wheel arches give a sense of volume to the body in profile. The SUV aesthetic is enhanced by the addition of a rear skid plate garnish and reflectors, as well as the standard fitment of tasteful 18- or 19-inch aluminium alloy wheels.Innovative cabinWithin, the Carnival’s sleek design elements and quality materials come together to create a refined, harmonious and sophisticated space. The central facia stack takes on a premium image with high-gloss black surfaces, while a signature chrome garnish runs the length of the dash to create a sense of width, space and openness in the forward cabin. In addition to the Carnival’s elevated interior styling, it offers plenty of space for seven- or eight-passenger flexibility, comfort for long road trips, or short local trips. With all seats erected, the Carnival offers a useful 1,139ls of luggage space. Remove the second row and stow the third flush with the floor, and that figure increases to a massive 4,110ls.Economy and powerKia’s brand-new ‘Smartstream’ 2.2 CRDi turbodiesel engine is the perfect partner for the Carnival. It’s more powerful than the outgoing 2.2 CRDi yet is more efficient, boasting 148kW at 3,800r/min. The ‘Smartstream’ engine finds the perfect companion in Kia’s 8-speed torque-converter automatic transmission, which offers smooth shifts.

Forward collision avoidance assist, blindspot collision avoidance assist, rear cross-traffic alert, lane-keeping assist, smart cruise control, amongst others, are all there to ensure your safety whilst in the Carnival.
