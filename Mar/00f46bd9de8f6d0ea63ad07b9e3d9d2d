Digital customer journeyThe 3D technology has been used to improve the consistency and fit of the product and shorten lead times as well as reduce the cost of clothing sample production. These 3D assets also enable one to create realistic simulations of a garment in the physical world, for example to showcase the movement of ultra-soft fabric with extreme stretch that enhances comfort and recovery. Using 3D visual images in shop front windows and for in-store marketing activations, customers will be able to scan a QR code on the Refinery garments and other marketing elements in the stores. Scanning the QR code will reveal a stretching and moving 3D avatar dressed in the campaign garments, giving a lifelike representation as when worn.

This is transformative and opens many opportunities for Refinery to enhance the experience for our customers,” says Shaun Hoddy, CEO of Refinery.
