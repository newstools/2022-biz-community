Goodman was the winner of the ‘art’ category, having submitted three photographs from three different shoots as part of his entry.   “As this is considered one of the most prestigious awards in the world of photography it’s a very surreal and humbling experience. Even more so, is now being part of the Hasselblad family - a brand I've admired from the beginning of my photography journey,” Goodman said.Image by Gavin GoodmanAs well as being named a ‘Hassleblad Master’ as part of his prize, he will be partaking in fulfilling a brief for a new collaborative project set by the brand.  “Each winner receives a new Hasselblad camera system and lens to keep, as well as a theme/brief from Hasselblad - we are then asked to conceptualize an 8 -10 image series based on this theme. We pitch our concept to the Hasselblad team and receive a budget to help finance the production. The images are then printed and released in the biennial Hasselblad Masters book,” Goodman explained.
