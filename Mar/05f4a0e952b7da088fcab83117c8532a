As they appeal to everyday South Africans, Twizza wanted to deepen their understanding of the market to be able to continue to be authentic to the communities they serve. At the end of 2021, they put their business out to pitch, and HelloFCB+ were eager to put their best foot forward, and it showed! We were awarded the business just days after pitching and the celebrations – and partnership – began.“We have completed our evaluation of all the pitch proposals submitted this week. There’s no way to sugar coat it…” said Lance Coertzen, Group marketing manager. “The proposal from HelloFCB+ blew us away. Your attention to detail and understanding of our positioning was impressive to say the least.”As an agency that is all about human connections, we are excited to make 2022 the year that we put the Twizza brand into the minds, hearts, and homes of every single South African. HelloFCB+ and Twizza have a shared vision to make brand communication that is impactful, that resonates, and that is personal. Lance Coertzen continues: “Your team was professional throughout the process, and it was clear to us that you really want to work on our business.” There couldn’t be a truer statement! Cheers to building the brand together and making work that works. Managing director Danielle Sneiders says: “We are honoured to appoint an iconic South African brand such as Twizza and look forward to partnering to take the brand to new heights.”
