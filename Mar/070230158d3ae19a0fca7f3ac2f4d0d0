This poses significant individual concern and discomfort, population health risk and a health economic challenge.”“Throughout the pandemic we have supported members of schemes administered by Discovery Health with up-to-date and factual clinical information regarding Covid-19. We believe our partnership with MyHealthTeam to launch myCOVIDteam is an extension of this very important work. We consider it critical to facilitate interaction between affected patients through secure communities which encourage information sharing, learning and support.”“A strong, medically-sound, social network is key in helping people navigate the challenges of Long Covid, feel supported, less isolated, and truly informed about a disease which the world’s scientific community continues to learn about. We believe that myCOVIDteam will provide much needed empathy and practical know-how to people facing both acute and long-haul Covid-19 symptoms.”An initiative open to people around the globePeople in 13 countries – United States of America, South Africa, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Ireland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, and Finland - can now connect with others facing the challenges of Covid-19 illness at www.mycovidteam.com.
