“We are all about doing things differently and are known for challenging the norm with our products and unique experiences. Savanna Chilled Chilli is the beginning of a new trend when it comes to ciders and the product you need to spice up your next get-together and spark up conversations,” says Eugene Lenford, marketing manager at Savanna. “Our new spicy kid on the block is just in time for spicier times. South Africans love a bit of spice when it comes to food, drinks, the weather and even their tweets. This innovation is boundary pushing in a sea of safe innovations around fruit flavours.”There’s nothing ‘safe’ about the campaign either. It begins with the launch of the Chilled Chilli TVC starring Chakalaka Norris, South Ahhh’s very spiciest. How spicy? So spicy he eats Nando’s chicken in Savanna ads. Yes you read that right. Two of SA’s spiciest brands have hooked up a collab on this campaign to show the industry flames, and a special meal combo is available at licensed Nando’s stores nationwide.If that isn’t enough, you can also get the erm, VIP treatment at an exclusive pop-up experience called the BS BAR. The ‘BS’ stands for ‘Bad Service’ and it sure is the spiciest establishment to grace South Africa in 2022. One thing is sure, it will have you in stitches and there will be plenty Savanna Chilled Chilli to try.Now at all major liquor outlets new Savanna Chilled Chilli is available in 330ml bottle. Best served chilled, it delivers the crisp, dry premium cider experience that you know and love, with hints of chilli and ginger.  Easily identifiable with a hint of red on the bottle and with an alcohol percentage of 5.5%, Savanna Chilled Chilli is the hottest new accessory in stores, bars and taverns across SA. Spicy.
