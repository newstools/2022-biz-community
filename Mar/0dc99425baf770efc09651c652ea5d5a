Munya Chanetsa, founder of MOTI AfricaThe project has been in the pipeline for several years and is finally ready for the public domain to aid all the creatives across the continent. Music business information sourceThe source for music business information, MOTI is an online skill sharing platform that addresses basic information on the music industry that is currently not readily available to the creative sector. “There is plenty of musical talent in the continent, but what is lacking is basic business knowledge that is a necessity for making success of the creatives,” says Munya Chanetsa, founder of MOTI Africa. “This platform provides a step-by-step narrative, through videos, for anyone wanting to enter the music industry as it covers all that is needed to know right from the music industry as it covers all that is needed to know right from the beginning,” Chanetsa explains. Two essential toolsIt will also introduce the MOTI Digital split sheet and metadata form, two essentials tools which are easily available and completed as soon as a song is made to avoid mundane problems in the future that are common in the music industry. An ‘Ask A MOTI’ feature is available on the website where questions can be asked, and answers will be provided live via social media platform such as WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter and TikTok.To kickstart this platform the launch will begin with a ‘M.O.T.I Music Business Plan’ video which is going to be followed with new uploaded videos that highlight other key requirements, such as “The Key Team Members” “Importance of Split Sheets” “What Is A CMO” and “What are NFTs”.
