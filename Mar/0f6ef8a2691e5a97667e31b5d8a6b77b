It is truly an international city and well known as a great gastronome destination. The V&A Waterfront is the city’s jewel, attracting millions of local and international tourists so it was an absolute no brainer that the second Tang would open there. You simply cannot beat the magnificent view of Table Mountain and the yacht harbour from Tang V&A Waterfront!” said van der Walt.Image supplied: Tang specialises in luxury Asian cuisineVan der Walt, who opened Tang in Sandton in May 2021 had considered offered sites in Dubai - but felt it was best to consolidate Tang’s position in South Africa before looking offshore.He said, “We are deeply honoured to have been approached by the V&A who asked us to extend our culinary journey set in a lavish Asian tropical setting to their home,” said the seasoned businessman whose previous restaurant ventures have included Circle, the celebrated Greenside Johannesburg eatery, and Sandton’s 1886. Alex Kabalin, executive for retail at the V&A Waterfront said Tang’s arrival is part of the precinct’s revamp of their restaurant line-up.Image supplied: Nicky van der Walt“Tang is a good example of the new type of restaurants we are attracting, and they will bring a new and unique flavour to the contemporary and sophisticated selection of sensory dining experience we have at the Waterfront in a setting that we are sure our visitors will enjoy,” van der Walt concluded.Tang V&A Waterfront will continue the luxe-with-an-edge style of its Joburg counterpart, with award-winning interior designer Tristan Du Plessis again helming the design of the establishment.
