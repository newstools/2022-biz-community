Image supplied: Cover art for Take My Hand by Louise CarverThe Take My Hand tour will go from 7 April to 30 April. For all tour dates and to buy tickets, go here. Written by Carver, Take My Hand celebrates life and being together again after lockdown and social isolation. The energy of the song is driven by a sexy urban dance beat created by Simphiwe ‘Simz’ Kulla from popular SA Afro Pop/Soul band, The Muffinz. Carver and Simz recorded the single towards the latter part of 2021.Upbeat and engaging from the start Take My Hand kicks off 2022 with a great celebration for Carver. “Everything about this euphoric song makes you want to dance, exhale and feel human again. I loved working with Simz because what we both bring to the table is completely different and unique, which makes for a great collaboration and fusion of sounds,” she said. Take My Hand is also the first single to be released from Carver’s forthcoming and 7th Studio album due for release later this year.
