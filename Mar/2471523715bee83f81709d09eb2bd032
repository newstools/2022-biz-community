TikTok boasts an impressive 1 billion monthly active users worldwide and is the fastest growing social media platform of all time. In South Africa, TikTok reports 9 million active users. The vast majority of TikTok users are below the age of 30, which has brought about concerns that the popular social media app can distract young minds. However, TikTok doesn't have to be a distraction and has already proved itself to be a valuable tool in helping educators reach and engage with learners on a level that is meaningful and relevant. Due to its widespread use among teens and young adults, TikTok has become a platform with enormous cultural significance to the younger generations; this presents a unique opportunity for educators to engage with their learners in a way to which they can relate. Moreover, the social media app is free to use, easily accessible and comes with unique creative video-creating features, which can act as an innovative instrument in an educator’s toolbox. Many educators have already discovered a vast number of advantages in the use of TikTok for teaching purposes. Claudine James, aged 54, began uploading her lessons on TikTok after persistent requests from her learners. In November 2020, James posted her first TikTok video, a short two-minute-long grammar lesson. In a week, her account (@iamthatenglishteacher) reached 10,000 followers. Within six weeks, her teaching account reached an impressive 100,000 followers; at present, she has more than 3,2 million followers from all over the world – far more followers than the number of learners in her classroom. James represents just one example of how educational material is greatly welcomed by learners on TikTok. Although these teachers were not on a search for fame when they began uploading “mini-lessons” on TikTok, the amount of interest shown in these educators’ accounts provide us with a sneak peek into the potential that TikTok has in the world of education. Furthermore, this social media app can be an engaging way to liven up a lesson, or create mini-lessons, and acts as a possible alternative to other video creating and sharing platforms with many creative features to captivate a learner’s interest. One of our very own Subject Matter Experts (also called SMEs, which is equivalent to a lecturer) at MSC Business College, Zizipho Mdondolo, began using TikTok as an educating tool back in 2020 after being introduced to its educational benefits. Mdondolo praises the creative tools found on TikTok that many use to make their videos fun and exciting, and says that she was inspired by the creativity and engagement she observed when other SMEs created educational videos on this app. Moreover, Mdondolo says that she highly recommends the use of TikTok to engage with learners, stating that, “Thus far, it has been a great tool to use for introducing a new topic or weekly updates”. It is evident, not only by its enormous audience, but also by learners’ keen interest in educational videos, that TikTok has already proved itself to be a valuable tool in the education world, for educators and learners alike. Many educators have not yet taken the opportunity to take advantage of the potential to easily create videos that will captivate the engagement of learners. The use of this app for educational purposes is still mostly untapped and has the ability to become widely accepted as a norm in schools or institutions of higher education, providing exceptional benefits to the learning environment. This presents educators with a unique opportunity to innovate and engage with learners on a relatable level to unlock the effect of education even further.
