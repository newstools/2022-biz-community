"Realising that we live in a globalised world where businesses need to build relationships with partners around the world, opens up a huge field of creative opportunities. Especially when addressing really niche target groups, creatives are challenged to find new ways of communicating. "And the cliche that B2B advertising is unemotional and boring is passé: businesses are people. They read your stuff. So be nice, surprising and creative," says Maun.
