Deadline for the early bird entry is 3 May with entries closing on 31 May.  The globally respected Loeries Creative Week will be held between 3 to 14 October. A celebration of innovative workThe Loeries celebrate the innovative work done by brands, agencies, production companies and individuals in their pursuit of communication that creates a positive impact on the lives of consumers and the economy. The focus areas are every point where a brand interacts with people from traditional categories such as film, print and radio as well as areas such as digital, design, music videos, architecture, live events, PR, shared value and service design. The Loeries is a yardstick of how strong partnerships between brands and agencies can yield a creative product that truly creates positive impact, as highlighted by Xolisa Dyeshana, chief creative officer for Joe Public United. “Being recognised as Agency of the Year for four years in a row is a testament to the incredible partnerships, we have with our clients who work with us to achieve our purpose of growth and the hard work and dedication of our people,” says Dyeshana, “It is built on the mutual belief in the power of an excellent product to drive real business growth.”A valuable resourceThe Loeries is not only a celebration of the region’s best work but also acts as a valuable resource to brands, who are looking for the best agency partners, and to agencies, who use their Loeries wins to secure even more work in a competitive regional landscape.“Winning a Loerie is not just prestigious but can also prove to be a catalyst for greater business success,” says Loeries CEO, Preetesh Sewraj. “The Loeries continue to shine a spotlight on those brands, agencies, production companies and individuals who truly continue to create work that moves their businesses and, ultimately, society forward,” he says. The Loeries began 44 years ago with the core goal of recognising, rewarding, inspiring and fostering creativity – a mission it continues nearly half a century later.For more information and to enter the awards, visit loeries.comFor more:Official site: www.loeries.com, Facebook,  Twitter, InstagramMore info: Loeries Creative Week, Bizcommunity search, Google, Twitter
