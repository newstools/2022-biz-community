From local industrial and furniture designers to fabric and furnishings experts, leading audiovisual authorities, the country’s most exciting ceramicists and interior design studios, architecture doyens and sustainability innovators – Design Joburg ticks all the boxes as far as décor and design in Southern Africa goes. “Design Joburg is also an opportunity to meet the people making waves in the broader creative arena; including architecture, decor, design and fashion and to experience their work while tapping into their insights first hand. “Glocal” creativity“Its return marks real conversations on the local and global design landscape and how these continue to shape the future of design and its evolving role in the human psyche,” says Mabuza, who explains that this year Design Joburg also plays host to an even more evolved iteration of the show’s CoLabs concept, where local designers work together to create evocative and boundary-pushing room sets. “As the world looks to the African continent for creative inspiration, Design Joburg is set to redefine collaboration as a design tool for progressive thinking as Africa’s leading design event, bringing together the very best of “glocal” creative trailblazers and innovators.“Design leaders and followers alike are assured of a cutting edge experience where they will be fed on a multitude of levels – leaving them inspired and certainly proud to be witness to some of the best design innovators and innovations of our times,” adds Makgamatha. The event has also turned an intentional lens on upcoming talent, many of whom have been mentored by established designers.Fringe factorAn innovation from 2021, the Design Joburg Collective is now a permanent feature and must-do for the local décor world’s decision makers and devotees alike.
