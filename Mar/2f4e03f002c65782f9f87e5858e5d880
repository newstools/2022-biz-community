Winning five awards in the country’s biggest awards ceremony is a massive achievement.” “The Covid-19 pandemic wreaked havoc around the world in the last two years and it placed SA Rugby under huge strain with matches being cancelled and the sport literally coming to a halt for almost two full seasons, so to win the National Federation of the Year award was also very rewarding,” Alexander continued.  Schoenmaker said, "What an honour. I always get the question, 'how much does my team contribute to my success?' Well, my team, everyone is everyone supporting me and who has my back. So, it’s an easy question to answer. They are my success. Everyone is a winner. This is dedicated to every athlete out there who perseveres. I always say that a happy swimmer is a fast swimmer. You must love your sport because you are allowed to do it.”Award winnersSports Star of the Year: Tatjana SchoenmakerSportsman of the Year: Makazole MapimpiSportswoman of the Year : Tatjana SchoenmakerCoach of the Year: Rassie ErasmusNewcomer of the Year: Miné De KlerkSportsman of the Year with a Disability: Pieter Du PreezSportswomen of the Year with a Disability : Anrunè Liebenberg -WeyersTeam of the Year: SpringboksRecreation Body of the Year: Local Surf Lounge Academy,National Federation of the Year: SA RugbySport Administrator of the Year: Ndumiso Njabulo NyawoseIndigenous Games Team of the Year nominees: KwaZulu-NatalVolunteer of the Year: Owen Gabaotswe
