Scan Display was contracted by design house TAG Design (now Bryce Henderson Design, or BHD), to fit out the space, installing flooring, electrics and lighting, ceiling features, fitting rooms and shelving units. Architect Bryce Henderson, who is a director of BHD, was responsible for the store design. The sleek and modern interior has clever nautical references (echoing the mall’s design theme) while providing a versatile backdrop to promote the 22 brands housed there, which include clothing, jewellery and accessories brands like Leigh Schubert and Dr Pachanga.   “As an entrepreneur, this project is close to my heart,” says Scan Display’s managing director Justin Hawes. “Scan Display’s origin story is also that of a small business, which I founded 24 years ago. We’ve grown the business so that today we can provide a turnkey solution for retail environments, including all fittings, décor, electrics and lighting, flooring and branding. We also provide exhibition and event infrastructure, build exhibition stands, and stock a wide range of display products.”Henderson says he chose Scan Display as a service provider due to their industry experience, past projects, and that they have their own factory as well as in-house designers and services, all of which made the project more seamless.Despite strikes affecting the delivery of steel and other essential items, the team was able to complete the job in time – an achievement that has been credited to their experience working in the exhibition industry, with its tight turnaround times to deliver (often) complex stands.Rian Thompson, centre manager of Table Bay Mall, says: “This space has only been open for two and a half months but has received a positive response from our community.”He continues: “It’s a real privilege to be able to support small businesses in this manner. While we’re honoured to give entrepreneurs the opportunity they deserve, we’re also proud to be nurturing the incredible talent and skill that’s so richly present in South Africa. The fashion space is especially exciting in this regard, and we’re delighted to give our shoppers more choice, a greater range and a chance to get behind our local designers.”To find out more about this and Scan Display’s other capabilities, please contact Justin Hawes at az.oc.yalpsidnacs@nitsuj or on + 27 11 447 4777, or visit Scan Display’s website.
