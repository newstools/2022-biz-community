Furthermore, on a macro scale, South Africa’s economy continues to be negatively impacted and will need increased power generation that is cost effective in order to increase investor confidence. “With this option, renewable energy IPPs, will have the opportunity to work alongside the systems operator to get more green electrons on the grid relatively quickly as the maximum amount of electricity generation capacity per project will be capped at 100MW, thereby negating the need for additional licensing,” concluded Govender.
