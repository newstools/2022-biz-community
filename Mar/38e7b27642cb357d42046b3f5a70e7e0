Pittman's decision on January 6 to deny the request from the FDA to suppress the data for the next 75 years. The court order will see 55,000 pages of Pfizer data released per month that was used to authorise their Covid-19 vaccine produced with BioNTech - a German biotechnology company based in Mainz that develops and manufactures active  immunotherapies for patient-specific approaches to the treatment of diseases.It is alleged one of the documents shows that BioNTech paid the FDA a "Prescription Drug User Fee Payment" of $2,875,842 on 20 April  2021 for the "Cominarty Covid-19 mRNA Vaccine" which the FDA subsequently approved in August 2021. A closer look at the FDA reveals payment of drug-user fees to the FDA is not uncommon, however.The FDA more recently announced its rates for prescription drug user fees for the fiscal year 2022: "User Fee Amendments of 2017 authorizes FDA to collect application fees for certain applications for the review of human drug and biological products, and prescription drug program fees for certain approved products," it states.The FDA also announced in an announced notice that it is establishing the fee rates for the 2022 fiscal year. Herein it states an application requiring clinical data has a fee rate of $3,117,218; an application not requiring clinical data is set at $1,558,609 and an application for a prescription drug program fee is set at $369,413. These fees were effective on 1 October 2021.1291 listed adverse events linked to Pfizer-BioNTech vaccinePfizer's court-mandated data shows that both Pfizer/BioNTech and the FDA were aware of at least 1291 adverse events linked to the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine before granting full approval to its distribution in August 2021World first as SA lab makes mRNA Covid vaccine using Moderna data18 Feb 2022A 38-page report included in the documents features an Appendix, "List of Adverse events of Special Interest," that lists  1291 different adverse events following vaccination. The list includes acute kidney injury, brain stem embolism, thrombotic cerebral infarction, cardiac arrest, cardiac failure, tachycardia, jugular vein embolism,  frontal lobe epilepsy, deep vein thrombosis, facial paralysis, interstitial lung disease and Type 1 diabetes mellitus.In the case of foetuses and neo-natals it lists the following adverse events: neonatal juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, death neonatal, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, stillbirth and fetal distress,  24,402 reported deaths following Covid-19 vaccinations in the USAccording to US Chlldren's Health Defense from mid-December 2020 through February 18 2022, the US government's database shows that the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), has received 1,134,984 reports of adverse events, including 24,402 deaths, following Covid vaccination. Additionally, there have been 4,021 cases of myocarditis and pericarditis in the US with 2,475 cases associated with  Pfizer, 1364 cases with Moderna and 171 cases with J&J's Covid vaccine. These include 643 reports of myocarditis and pericarditis in children aged 12 to 17. "These findings should put an immediate end to the Pfizer Covid vaccines. The potential for serious harm is very clear, and those injured by the vaccines are prohibited from suing Pfizer for damages," said US Children's Health Defense (CHD) president Mary Holland."VAERS data show the catastrophic health impacts the vaccine is having on millions of people, yet Pfizer and other vaccine makers have no fear of being held accountable for injuries and deaths from their vaccines."The ramifications of the two-dose and booster vaccine for Africa remain unclear, particularly within the context of BioNTech introducing its first modular mRNA manufacturing facility to promote scalable vaccine production in Africa, as announced by BioNTech on 16 February 2022.Pfizer/BioNTech booster jab for adolescents awaiting authorisationMeanwhile, Pfizer and BioNTech announced on 24 February that the European Medicines Agency's CHMP - the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use - issued a positive opinion on the administration of the companies' booster dose of Covid-19 vaccine Cominarty. The booster jab is to be administered at least six months after the second dose in adolescents 12 through 17 years of age.mRNA Tech transfer hub beneficiaries announced21 Feb 2022"The European Commission (EC) will review the CHMP recommendation and is expected to make a final decision on a variation to the Conditional Marketing Authorization in the near future," it said."If the EC grants the variation, the decision will be immediately applicable to all 27 EU member states, making booster vaccines available to everyone 12 years and older."The Covid-19 vaccine booster for individuals 12 through 15 years of age was already granted Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA earlier this year as an expansion to the existing EUA for the primary series. The companies are also planning to file the data with other regulatory authorities in the coming weeks.The Pfizer-BioNtech Covid-19 vaccine is currently the only Covid-19 vaccine authorised for this age group as a booster in the US and Europe.
