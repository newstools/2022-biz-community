But now, Heineken has decided to leave Russia completely."We are shocked and deeply saddened to watch the war in Ukraine continue to unfold and intensify. We earlier announced that Heineken stopped new investments and exports to Russia, ended the production, sale and advertising of the Heineken brand, and announced that we will not accept any net financial benefits or profit from our business in Russia."Following the previously announced strategic review of our operations, we have concluded that Heineken’s ownership of the business in Russia is no longer sustainable nor viable in the current environment. As a result, we have decided to leave Russia."Production, sale and advertising of Heineken beer halted in Russia10 Mar 2022Reduced operations during transition periodThe brewer said it aims for an orderly transfer of the business to a new owner in full compliance with international and local laws.
