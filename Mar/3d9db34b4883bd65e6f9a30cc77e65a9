The feature, which is free to use, gives people the chance to view products from the profiles of their favorite brands, so when they talk about and discover products on the timeline, they can now browse them on Twitter, too."When you go to the profile of a merchant that has Twitter Shops enabled, you’ll see a 'View shop' button just above their Tweets. When you tap the button, it will open up that merchant’s shop, where you can scroll through items. When you’re ready to purchase, you can click on the product of your choice which will open an in-app browser where you can learn more about the product and checkout on the merchant’s website," Twitter said in a blog post.Twitter has launched a beta experiment for Twitter Shops.
