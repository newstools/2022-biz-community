Therefore, all UIF training projects must be linked to employment creation because we do not want learners to idle at home upon completion of training,” he said.Speaking at the launch, FUZE Chief Executive Officer, Thandi Ngcobo, revealed that 14,771 beneficiaries have been employed by the Department of Education in KwaZulu-Natal after completing their training.She said the Department of Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs in KwaZulu-Natal has pledged to support the 5,000 learners' co-operatives by purchasing their farming produce while Link Africa has committed to employing the 150 beneficiaries as fibre optic technicians upon completion of training. Ngcobo added that the mixed farming learners focus on poultry, piggery, vegetables, eggs and smoothies.The Director-General of Employment and Labour, Thobile Lamati, said the department is committed to playing its role in job creation.“We are worried about the growing unemployment in the country. However, we pledge to play our role in projects such as this launch, which includes jobs, especially for young people. To the learners, I urge you not to waste this opportunity because it comes once in a while,” Lamati said.Beneficiaries of the UIF training programmes also attended the launch and shared their experiences.Bayanda Zaca, one of the beneficiaries related that he often worked odd construction jobs before starting the UIF training.“Today, I am head chef at a top restaurant in Durban after undergoing the UIF culinary training. I am also helping the new trainees at the food-processing centre in Ndwedwe. I am truly grateful to the UIF for turning my life around,” he said.Lethabo Tsonope, who was funded by the UIF, revealed that she was a commercial pilot for FlySafair, flying a Boeing 783-800.“I never thought in my wildest dreams that I would become a pilot because it was so expensive and affordability was a problem. I am grateful to be where I am today and urge young girls to put God first to succeed,” she said.
