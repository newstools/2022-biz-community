Andrew Buckland and Sylvaine Strike team up for Firefly16 Mar 2022Mkosi said, “By reimagining this iconic story, the aim is to amplify the voice of women in the story. This will contribute towards the much-needed efforts to curb the silencing of the female voice in society, which often leads to increased abuse against them, whether by their intimate partners, as was the case in this particular story, or in other spheres of women’s lives.”Mkosi said that the focus of the story becomes that of Matilda, a violinist and leader of a symphonic orchestra in Johannesburg in the 1950s, which breaks from previous approaches that portrayed Matilda as a victim.By placing a different spin on the story, the producers aim to tell a classic South African tale through a female lens. The musical also addresses the issue of gender-based violence head-on, creates a multi-genre experience and places music at the centre of the narrative with original compositions performed live by a youth orchestra.In addition to Kunene as cuckolded husband Philemon, Sokhulu as Matilda/Mbalenhle and Temba as the love interest Thozamile/Orpheus, the musical will also introduce two gifted classical musicians to audiences – violinist Lebogang Ledwaba as the young Matilda and violist Kgaugelo Mpiyane as the young Thozamile.An exchange with Brian Temba: Nurturing the music industryBy Emily Stander 2 Mar 2022Supporting actors include veterans Job Kubatsi, Alistair Dube and Khanyo Maphumulo and singer Lebo Moalusi.Mutloatse said, “It has taken all of three years, two of which were disabled by the Covid-19 lockdown restrictions, to get this thoroughly therapeutic musico-dramatico, The Suit Concer-tized, back to where it belongs – on a live stage – featuring an ensemble of actors and musicians of the highest calibre.”He said it was exciting to have such an illustrious cast sharing the stage for the first time in their illustrious careers, backed by a strong creative and technical team with so many dynamic women at its core.This production is set to be an ensemble mix of drama, classical, gospel, choral and jazz inflections and themes, largely influenced by the rich diversity of what could be referred to as the Sophiatown Renaissance, infused with modern-day original, authentic South African sounds.Make a date to see The Suit Concert-ized at Gold Reef City’s Lyric Theatre from 20 to 22 May 2022.
