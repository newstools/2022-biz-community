The R1.5m donation from KFC Add Hope will see more children being reached and help us extend our support across nine schools in the Western Cape.”Nel explains that KFC Add Hope remains committed to helping as many children as possible obtain access to the nutrition they need to learn, grow and thrive. “The sad reality is that many children in the Western Cape arrive at school daily with an empty stomach. We know that a hungry child is one that would not be able to realise his or her potential and this is why we are committed to ensuring that South Africa’s less privileged children receive a nutritious breakfast and lunch at school every day to enable them to learn and function well, and empower them to reach their full potential,” Nel says.
