Source: PixabayOriginally conceptualised as a simple "withdraw" vs "remain" list, the list of companies commensurate with their involvement with Russia, now consists of five categories. These are:• Withdrawal - companies that have made a clean break with the country, that have completely halted their engagements with Russia and/or have exited the country. • Suspension -  companies that have kept their options open for return. These are companies that are temporarily curtailing operations while keeping return-options open.• Scaling back - companies that are reducing activities. These are companies that are scaling back some business operations while continuing others.• Buying time - companies that are holding off new investments or developments. These are companies that are postponing future planned investment, development or marketing while continuing substantive business.• Digging in - companies that are defying demands for exit. These are companies that are defying demands to exit Russia or to reduce their activities,Download the list of these companies by clicking  here. The list is updated continuously by Jeffrey Sonnenfeld and his team of experts, research fellows, and students at the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute to reflect new announcements from companies in as close to real time as possible. The list has already garnered extensive coverage for its role in helping catalyse the mass corporate exodus from Russia. When this list was first published the week of 28 February, only several dozen companies had announced their departure."Hundreds of companies have withdrawn in the days since, and we are humbled that our list helped galvanise millions around the world to raise awareness and take action,"  a spokesperson from the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute said."Although we are pleased that our list has been widely circulated across company boardrooms, government officials, and media outlets as the most authoritative and comprehensive record of this powerful, historic movement, we are most inspired by the thousands of messages we have received from readers across the globe, especially those from Ukraine, and we continue to welcome your tips, insights, and feedback."#1.
