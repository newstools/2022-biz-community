Brought on in the role of creative director (content and social). Jeanette was mandated to only grow the social team (and social offering) – when she arrived there was a team of two social media managers – but to also make sure all the content Grey creates answers to a certain creative standard, and that social media is integrated into everything the agency does. A part of this was training client service and ops teams (as well as creatives) up in the “mystical ways of the digital”. She has proven to be exceptionally good at attracting both new business and great new talent. Five years later, Jeanette leads a productive, happy, and highly profitable team of 20, consisting of social media managers, digital designers, multimedia designers, content writers, and community managers. Jeanette is passionate about good content (and letting data inform good content) and sees herself as a storyteller, writer, and ideas person who loves leading social and content teams in telling a brand's story online. Fran Luckin, CCO of Grey Africa, says, “Jeanette is a breath of fresh air in a field that is too often filled with jargon and driven by stale, template-based creativity.”
