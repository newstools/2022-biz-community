From flavouring your world to lighting things up, the new Tabasco® brand identity is a bold and dynamic system designed to contemporise and amplify the iconic elements of the Tabasco brand. With the launch of two new variants in the local market – Sriracha and Scorpion (Tabasco®’s hottest offering) – in-store and on social media, creative agency Grey South Africa and creative, data-led media agency Mediology collaborated to leverage the hyper-local power of billboards and street pole ads as an intercept in the consumer’s path to purchase.  "Using location and audience insights supported by strong creative, OOH was the ideal platform to showcase Tabasco’s new flavours, creating top-of-mind awareness during the last window in consumer’s path to purchase,” says Christo van den Bergh, Head of OOH from Mediology.The campaign features unique and expressive design from Grey South Africa, showcasing the product and catchy taglines, to the backdrop of delicious food. With external and digital illuminations across Gauteng and the Western Cape, consumers are introduced to Sriracha - Hard to pronounce. Easy to eat.; Scorpion - Flavour Responsibly and, of course, reminded of the classic red pepper sauce - The sauce other sauces want to grow up to be."The team loved working with the new Tabasco® brand identity - it's an exciting refresh that really lends itself to prominent out-of-home spaces," explains Jeanette Grove, ECD at Grey Advertising. "We've been building the brand online for the last 10 years, so to see it shine on billboards and street poles again is a real privilege.""While Tabasco® has been doing great things in the social media and in-store spaces, we haven't seen this brand on a billboard in quite a while," says Lyn Nunn, marketing manager at Rialto. "It's exciting to see our favourite hot sauce get the recognition and exposure it deserves."Keep an eye out and give the new sauces a try!
