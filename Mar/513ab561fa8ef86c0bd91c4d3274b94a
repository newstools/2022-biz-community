My Community Connects has stemmed from the message of this campaign. Phase one of My Community Connects showcased Soweto's creative industries, with Sipho 'Hotstix' Mabuse as the campaign's headline mentor. This year's edition has expanded to incorporate social innovation in fields such as sports, science and technology, entrepreneurship, and academia. Building on last year's campaign, My Community Connects aims to foster skills, narrow the digital divide and create gainful employment opportunities for South Africans across sectors beyond the creative industry, all while showcasing the country’s diverse and vibrant talent pool.The Test Kitchen Carbon opens doors in Johannesburg3 days ago“As a fibre network operator, we don't just focus on laying fibre but also on creating connectivity that allows young entrepreneurs and creators to build their brand, communicate it, and get buy-in from prospective audiences and clients,” says Lianne Williams, head of marketing at Vuma. “Jimmy Nevis is the perfect partner for this year's campaign, which aims to enable people from all walks of life and in all industries to build visibility and extend their reach beyond the physical limitations of their environment.”"I grew up in a very community-oriented household and have always felt the need to help people realise just how achievable their dreams are," says Jimmy Nevis. “There are so many gifted and innovative individuals out there, and I’m glad to be working with Vuma to help mentor these talented people and help them realise that their dreams are attainable.”The campaign has already received countless entries from innovative South Africans, such as Zanele Khoza, founder of Inkosi TV, a free digital publishing company that tells positive African stories. Tshepiso Mahika, founder of Sushi Yase Soweto, has also entered - whose take on this traditional Japanese dish includes ingredients that are uniquely South African, such as biltong.“Being a part of My Community Connects is the perfect fit for our platform because it shares our vision to enable even more people to tell and consume authentic South African stories. I'm looking forward to reaching even more people through the My Community Connects platform and increasing our viewership," says Khoza.“This is an amazing initiative that's not only helping businesses like mine to grow but is ultimately improving our local economy. I'm confident this platform will help even more start-ups reach more customers and gain access to untapped markets," says Mahika.Like last year's initiative, My Community Connects will host a workshop where young, talented South Africans can engage with Jimmy Nevis, ask him questions and gain valuable insights and knowledge about the industry, as well as lessons in both personal and business growth.Google Arts and Culture launches Mali Magic10 Mar 2022Additionally, this year's campaign will feature a new element, where someone from each category will be recognised for their outstanding work.
