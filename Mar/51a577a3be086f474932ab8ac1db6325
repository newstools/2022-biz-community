Starring alongside award-winning Maria Doyle Kennedy (Outlander, Orphan Black, Kin) and Tony Kgoroge (Black Sails, Invictus, Long Walk to Freedom), the 10-episode series will be taking over the prime-time slot that traditionally belongs to the Sunday night movie. “I play the role of Grace Zihlangu who is a domestic worker in her early 50s. A quiet but determined woman with gravitas, she is by no means subservient to anyone in her little town,” says Duru. She lives for her son, but unforeseen circumstances compel her to shift focus and pursue the high hopes she’s always had for herself. “The role was emotionally demanding. It doesn't get more raw than a mother's feelings toward her child - but it was a wonderfully meaty role and I tried to portray it as truthfully as I could. “The professional, collaborative culture that was baked into the various facets of the production was amazing and I’m thankful to have swum in these creative waters,” she says. While filming the series, Duru took time off from Algoa FM Breakfast with Wayne, Lee and Charlie T. “Lee is indeed multi-talented, and we are very happy that the opportunity arose for her to showcase her experienced acting skills,” says Algoa FM’s managing director, Alfie Jay. “We are excited to tune in to M-Net at 8pm on the 20th of March, to watch Recipes for Love and Murder, starring our very own Lee,” he says. Lee is an integral part of the breakfast show alongside Wayne Hart and Charlton Tobias. She joined Algoa FM in 2016.
