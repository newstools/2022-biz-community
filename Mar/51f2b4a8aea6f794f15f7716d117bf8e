Absent: Franks Meat Mall, Middleburg.This year's awards, once again supported by Freddy Hirsch, honoured the top butcheries from both 2020 and 2021 at an awards luncheon held at  Emperors Palace on Thursday, 24 March.The Cleaver Awards, a Red Meat Industry Forum initiative, are held annually to recognise the country’s best butcheries based on quality, service, hygiene and value for money. The awards have become respected by consumers countrywide as a seal of approval. This is primarily due to the fact that butcheries, once they have entered, cannot nominate themselves, as the awards are given based on customer votes. All butcheries that receive over 100 votes are then anonymously audited by The South African Meat Industry Company (Samic) against an extensive 212-point checklist.“With lockdowns, changes in demand and shifts in consumer behaviour, our butcheries have had to become increasingly agile, in some instances transforming their approaches and accommodating new ways of business. And even though many were hit hard due to the pandemic, these Cleaver Awards confirm that our butcheries are still very much worth their beef,” says Dewald Olivier, executive officer of The South African Feedlot Association (Safa).Several common attributes amongst the winning butcheries have been reinforced, including training and upliftment of staff, a passion for the business, and above all else, customer-centricity, being core to any successful butchery.And the winners are...National Winners4 and more tills:Kings Meat Deli Castle Walk Erasmuskloof - Platinum        Impala Vleis Brits - Gold                Up to 3 tills:Franks Meat Mall Middelburg - Platinum        West End Vleismark, Kimberley - Gold                Meat Market:Bluff Meat Supply Beach Road, Durban - Platinum                Saveway Superspar, Witbank - Gold                Gauteng4 and more tills:Boma meat Market Moreleta Park - Platinum        Forsmay Muslim Butchery Fordsburg - Gold                Meat World Elarduspark - Gold                Up to 3 tills:Delft Butchery and Deli Randpark Ridge - Platinum        Meat Market:Uitkyk Meat & Supermarket Silverton - Platinum        Pick n Pay Family Store Brackenhurst - Gold                North West4 and more tills:Vision Meat Klerksdorp - Platinum        MpumalangaUp to 3 tills:Franks Meat CBD Middelburg - PlatinumMeat Market:Komatipoort SuperSpar - Platinum       Free State4 and more tills:Fredilia Meat, Welkom - Platinum        Up to 3 tills:Tevrede Vleismark, Vrede - Platinum        Eastern Cape4 and more tills:Cuyler Butchery, Uitenhage - Platinum        Meat Market:Levyvale SuperSpar, Uitenhage - Platinum        Swartkops Spar, PE - Platinum        Debi Lee SuperSpar, East London - Gold                Western CapeUp to 3 tills:Hartenbos Slaghuis, Hartenbos - Platinum        Darling Meat Market, Darling - Gold               KwaZulu-Natal4 and more tills:Michael Frey's Fresh Meat, Margate - Platinum        Bluff Meat Supply, Pietermaritzburg - Gold                Meat Markets:Bluff Meat Supply Richards Bay - Platinum        Bluff Meat Supply Pinetown - Gold                Limpopo4 and more tills:Vleislapa - Marshall Street, Polokwane - Platinum
