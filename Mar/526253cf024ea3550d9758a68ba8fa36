JPU group CEO Gareth Leck says, “Being further acknowledged by SCOPEN, this time as SA’s Best Agency to Work For, is an honour, and we owe it to our people. We truly believe growth comes from within, and without our incredible Joes at the helm, we wouldn’t be where we are today.”  SCOPEN’s Best Agency to Work For in SA 2021/22 report summarises the 156 creative professionals and 50 media professionals analysed, highlighting the essential criteria professionals consider when looking to stay or leave agencies.  The report indicates that company culture and the hunt for better professional growth opportunities are some of the reasons why creative professionals move agencies. Other areas that also influence this decision include on-the job challenges, work-life balance, and a higher salary.  Furthermore, intangible factors such as ‘credibility’ (how employees perceive their boss/leaders and the company) as well as ‘respect’ (how employees think their leaders see them) and are also seen as vital considerations.
