The Savanna brand is not shy to do things a little differently, so, for the launch of the brand’s spicy variant, ‘Chakalaka Norris’ the TVC and campaigns’ protagonist, is the spiciest celebrity in town. How spicy? So spicy he has no qualms about tucking into a delicious and spicy Nando's chicken in a Savanna ad.Devised by WPP Liquid for client Distell, and directed by Peter Pohorsky of Plank Film Productions, the spot strikes an instantly fun tone, making an instant icon out of Norris's sardonic charm and Grace Jones-esquecoolness. “South Africa has been holding out for a hero and Chakalaka Norris might just be that guy. Unless he’s busy that day,” explains Fran Luckin, chief creative officer, Grey Advertising Africa.Peter Pohorsky of Plank Film Productions comments: “This innovation is boundary-pushing in a sea of safe innovations around fruit flavours on the production.“Now at all major liquor outlets, the new Savanna Chilled Chilli is available in a 330ml bottle.
