In 2020, the pandemic had a significant impact on musicians’ ability to earn an income. Alternative sources of income needed to be explored - and Concerts SA’s research into digital live streaming initiatives in 2020 sought to provide a sense of the current live streaming landscape in the country. The research culminated in the release of the first Concerts SA Digital Mobility Fund in 2020.

Applicants hailed from all parts of South Africa and formed a rich kaleidoscope of cultures, traditions, genres, idioms and origins. The adjudication process was extremely challenging since a limited number of applications could be approved. The full list of projects selected for the Digital Mobility Fund can be found on the Concerts SA  website and include both established and emerging professional artists, across genres.
