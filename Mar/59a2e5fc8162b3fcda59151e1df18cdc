Companies from the largest to the smallest have used design as a strategic tool to strengthen their relationships with customers, engage them in the values of their brand and communicate their purpose to customers. In an increasingly competitive market in such challenging times, they have invested and reaped the measurable rewards of design.” “It is encouraging to see the growing diversity of products and services that have entered the awards and proven to the expert jury that design made the difference, in charities, social enterprises and public sector projects. The awards continue to represent the growth of design across service and digital experiences as well as point of sale and brand communication,” Grinyer continued.
