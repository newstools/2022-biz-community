Fuel suppliers however are paid in dollars, a scarce currency in Africa's top economy.Nigeria's fuel crisis has been exacerbated by imports of sub-standard petrol. This has angered motorists, who have been spending hours in lines to fill their tanks, while some public transport owners have taken advantage to hike fares.
