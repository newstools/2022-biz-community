The return service leaves from Harare at 1.20pm, touching down in Durban at 3.35pm. Travel time is approximately two hours and 10 minutes."Harare and Durban are important commercial centres and key Airlink markets. This brand new route linking the two cities will be our third direct service to Zimbabwe’s capital, along with our flights from Johannesburg and Cape Town.  We are certain that the new service will promote commerce and tourism between the cities and between KwaZulu-Natal and Zimbabwe.  "Having non-stop flights on the route means greater convenience and options for travellers who want to save time and avoid connecting at Johannesburg," said Rodger Foster, Airlink CEO and managing director. Airlink will operate one of its modern Embraer ERJ135 Regional Jets on the route.
