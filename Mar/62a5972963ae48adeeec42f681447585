Leading regional talk radio station 702 and its breakfast show host Bongani Bingwa are celebrating outstanding teachers.  	All South Africans are encouraged to share inspirational stories about teachers who made an impact in their lives on www.702.co.za. The only criteria is that the teacher should currently be in active service at a school. One exceptional teacher will be profiled per month from April to November 2022. The teacher will be selected based on the strength of the written motivation received, and the story it tells about the impact he or she made in someone's life. All monthly finalists and their nominators will be interviewed by 702 Breakfast show host Bongani Bingwa to share their story.  “Teachers play such a pivotal role in society. Not just as educators but also as role models, mentors, caregivers and advisers," says Mzo Jojwana, 702 station manager. "Now in a post-Covid reality we have a renewed appreciation of the gruelling, often thankless work they do. As a station we think it's time to applaud them and give them the recognition they deserve."People are invited to nominate a teacher who made a big impact on their, or their children's lives, by submitting their story on the 702 website. Tune in to 702 and Breakfast with Bongani Bingwa, weekdays 6am to 9am on 92.7 FM to join the conversation about these unsung heroes, and follow the inspirational stories on social media handle #702TeacherOfTheYear.
