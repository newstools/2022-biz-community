The insurer launched the second phase of its Big Ads for Small Business initiative last week.Helping SMEs thriveIn 2021, 12 small businesses - from a Johannesburg inner-city tailoring outfit, an aunt-and-niece-run landscaping firm and a township chicken restaurant to a small Soweto laundromat venture and a one-woman wine-distribution start-up - reaped phenomenal results from their participation in the campaign, including securing myriad new contracts and partnerships, setting up new franchises, expanding their markets and creating many more jobs in their communities.Each SMME received its own tailored media package, comprising anything from radio and television ads to billboard and digital advertising space, and the impact of the campaign was so big that Hollard wanted to expand it so more SMMEs could benefit.Now, the insurer is building on last year’s success with a second six-month phase of the campaign in a slightly different format, adding three more small businesses to the pool in a novel partnership with DStv.Summit of entrepreneurs driving continental prosperity25 Mar 2022A partnership proposal to Hollard from the satellite service at the end of last year provided the perfect opportunity to run a competition across three of its television channels - Mzansi Magic, kykNET and M-Net, and social media, inviting SMMEs to apply to become part of the 2022 Big Ads for Small Business campaign.Like last year, criteria for this year’s campaign included whether the small businesses would benefit from the campaign, could handle a potential rapid increase in business and were spread across the country. Overall, 248 applications were received, which were narrowed down to 10 with the help of a specialist business consultancy, and then to the final three successful applicants that met all the criteria: Timeless Tomatoes, Ambani Africa and 123tutors. From March to August 2022, Hollard will share two months of concurrent commercial airtime worth R1m with each of these enterprises on DStv channels and provide social media exposure on its channels.About the three innovative small businessSo, what gives the three successful contenders for 2022 an edge?
