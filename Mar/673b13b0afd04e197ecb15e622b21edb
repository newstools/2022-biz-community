While the sums involved in this particular case are relatively modest, the conviction and sentencing of these criminals should send a strong message to all Eskom employees that corrupt elements have no place in the organistaion.“This is only one of the many cases of corruption that Eskom is pursuing involving staff.”In September, former Eskom financial controller Mosai Moraka and Eskom service provider Victor Tshabalala were found guilty on 53 counts and will also forfeit R11m in properties to the state which will be sold and the proceeds directly paid to the power supplier.Court orders government to clean up air in coal belt22 Mar 2022Fictitious invoicesThe court found them guilty of creating fictitious invoices for Tshabala’s company and pocketing the proceeds – costing Eskom at least R35m.At least 53 fictitious invoices were created and paid between 2016 and 2018.The culmination of the case comes some two-and-half years after an investigation by the Eskom Audit and Forensics Department uncovered the wrongdoing.“What is most pleasing about this judgement is that the taxpayers will recover some of the stolen funds through the sale of the ill-gotten property belonging to the convicts,” De Ruyter said.
