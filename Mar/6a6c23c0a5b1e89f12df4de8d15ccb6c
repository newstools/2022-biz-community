The auction will go live on Rarible on 6 April with each G-NO starting at 0.1 ETH (0.1 ETH = +- 4,480.54ZAR). Rarible is a leading community-centric multichain NFT marketplace that is home to native NFT artists and projects such as Pak and Women Rise.“We’re excited to enter the NFT space with an art project that brings our story to life. We are known for pushing the limits of denim. Turning our mascot into a piece of digital denim art means we’re able to meet our audience's appetite for innovation and be in the spaces where they are,” says Gwenda van Vliet, the brand's CMO.Every single G-NO tells a different brand story and has been crafted using different denim fabrics and G-Star’s trademark details. Collectors will be the first to own a piece of G-Star Raw digitised denim while simultaneously owning a piece of the brand’s legacy. Buyers will also get an exclusive G-Star Raw product that matches the design and particular story behind their chosen G-NO.Building an engaged metaverse communityBut the company states that it's not "just another brand jumping on the NFT wave" for the sake of it. Instead, G-Star Raw wants to build a digital community that will collaboratively define what the brand should do in the Web 3.0 space.
