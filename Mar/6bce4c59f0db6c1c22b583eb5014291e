Coinciding with World Sleep Day on 18 March, multinational chemical producer BASF is proud to announce a Foam Factory collaboration designed to help put more South Africans to sleep.BASF’s Performance Materials team in South Africa is partnering with Foam Factory to incorporate BASF’s CosyPUR® memory foam into Foam Factory’s Driftaway pillows to create continual comfort pillows.CosyPUR® is a new viscoelastic polyurethane flexible foam that’s specifically adjustable thanks to cell morphology. What that means is it’s soft but supportive, giving you the perfect pillow on which to enjoy a good night’s rest.Taking flexible foam to the next level, the open cell structure of CosyPUR® foam lets air pass through the material. This dissipates body heat, allowing for more breathability and an overall better sleeping experience. The foam is versatile, so it’s suitable for more than just pillows; think cushions, back rests, mattresses, and orthopedic products.Sunneal Shah, BASF’s Team Leader: Sub Saharan Africa Performance Materials, explains how the innovative material enables smart sleep technology to be embedded in pillows and more. “BASF is at the forefront of developing innovative, high-performance polyurethane foams. These foams can be used to manufacture a variety of products, like the premium quality viscoelastic pillows that Foam Factory is producing. Using CosyPUR® in the Driftaway viscoelastic pillows helps ensure good posture during sleep,” says Shah.Neill Aitken, Sales Director at Foam Factory expands on the relationship between the companies and what that’s enabled. “Foam Factory has worked with BASF formulations for over 15 years, and we've been impressed with the amazing results. At Foam Factory, we believe in nurturing long-term relationships with our suppliers based on innovation, consistency, reliability, and flexibility. The ‘chemistry’ between our two organisations speaks volumes and we look forward to many more mutually successful years of collaboration.”To find out more about the pillows, or to buy your own, visit https://www.driftawaybeds.co.za/
