Staying true to the competition’s aim of showcasing Africa’s rich cultural heritage, the short films will feature reimagined African folktales presented in multiple African languages. The final six filmmakers will now go into the development phase of their projects, before starting production on the short films that will eventually premiere on Netflix as part of ‘An Anthology of African Folktales’ later this year.  The competition was launched by Netflix and Unesco in October 2021, with the goal of promoting diverse local stories and bringing them to the world. The competition was also a step towards creative equity - as part of the Netflix Creative Equity Fund, which aims at enabling new voices from underrepresented communities within entertainment to bring their perspectives to a global audience.“Congratulations to the six winners! The fact that their films will be shown to a global audience is part of our commitment to promote cultural diversity around the world. Like the African movie sector itself, these six individuals have a very bright future ahead of them. The laureates, and all the participants in this competition more broadly, highlight the rich, diverse and ever-evolving culture that Sub-Saharan Africa has to offer and that Unesco wants to promote. We cannot wait to celebrate these films at a special premier at Unesco headquarters in Paris at the end of this year,” said Audrey Azoulay, director-general of Unesco.Corona Studios launches in South Africa1 day agoBen Amadasun, Netflix director of content in Africa said, “It’s been a truly inspiring journey for us to experience the level of creative talent from our candidates.
