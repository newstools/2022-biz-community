Wavemaker South Africa believes that growth sometimes requires uncomfortable change. What matters is that these shifts are done in the best interests of the businesses it has long supported. Since October 2021, Wavemaker has worked to assist and support Pick n Pay with this move to in-house media-buying services.  Although the transition from outsourcing to insourcing can be difficult, having a strategic partner that is equally invested in your business can make the process easy and effective, and can help to ensure that no marketing momentum is lost.“Our successful partnership throughout the years has enabled us to provide the best solutions and strategic counsel to Pick n Pay. While we are truly sad to see this flagship client leave us, we are always supportive of progress and wish them well with their in-sourcing journey,” says Merissa Himraj, Wavemaker CEO SSA.
