The launch happened in an outdoor cinema and dessert bar ‘set’ on Nelson Mandela Square, Sandton on 10 March. Corona Studios, an in-house digital content entertainment franchise, will finance and release a slate of four, local, short format productions through 2022, showcasing Southern Africa as a key travel destination. This follows the global launch of Corona Studios in 2020 with the franchise series, Free Range Humans, in which, each season, eight individuals leave their conventional jobs behind to pursue a life of outdoor adventure.Between San and Insanity will be followed in April by the short format trilogy, Free Surfer.Between San and Insanity features South African environmental activist and pro surfer, Frank Solomon, as he abandons technology and big city life to journey to Namibia in pursuit of guidance and wisdom from the San people, reconnecting with nature and himself in the process.“South Africa has some of the finest content creators on the planet and we want Corona Studios to be a home for them. We’re encouraging directors, content creators and storytellers to reach out and pitch stories that tell the African experience through the lens of true stories, natural beauty, sustainability and that the outdoors is where we find the best version of ourselves,” says Melanie Nicholson, Corona SA marketing manager.
