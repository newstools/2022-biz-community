How will your background being on both sides of the fence, so to speak assist you in your new role? Being back from the “other side of the fence” allows me to play devil’s advocate before putting work in front of our clients. Having the “client” perspective makes me ask the right questions internally; “If I was still a client would I sign this off?” “Would this campaign make me want to put more budget behind it?” “Does this really push me and make me want to be brave?”.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important} Given the advertising industry has been slow in transforming, why is it important to be a woman in a leadership position in this industry? To quote our group CEO, Mzamo Xala: “Women represent one of the biggest consumer groups through their influence and buying power, and their impact on the economy is growing every year.” So how can we as an industry not see the power in this? So, appointments like mine must become more deliberate and I am honoured to be part of an agency that not only speaks it but leads the way. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important} What advice would you give to women looking to enter the industry?Step up.

Explain to us why and what this means in your everyday working life?So “Lifting as I Rise” is not just a philosophy I bandy about lightly – for me it is an action phrase. It is about fearless passion for growth of future leaders especially young women in the business and outside of the business not just through regular mentoring and coaching sessions, but real-time on the job training and for me this happens all day, every day.
