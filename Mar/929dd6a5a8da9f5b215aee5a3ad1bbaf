Image supplied: The Cleansing will happen at the Durban Botanic GardensThe Cleansing journeys into the heartland of Earth issues using this performance moment to negotiate the true meaning of ecology – the connectedness of human existence to all existence. “The Cleansing is a ritual for us humans and for the Earth – a cultural enactment of the sacred bond between the dancers and the ground they move on as they ‘cleanse’ themselves ready for a deeper connection to one another and to the Earth,” says artistic director Dr Lliane Loots. Believing that environmental justice is social justice, Flatfoot joins with long-time collaborator and poet Iain Ewok Robinson. His words flow with the dancers in an evocation that shouts out “surely the Earth can be saved for me”, “surely the earth can be saved for you”.  Choreographer Thamsanqa Tshabalala returns with contemporary piece2 days ago “Very loosely based on the impulses of Stravinsky’s 1913 music “Rite of Spring”, this site-responsive dance work asks of all of us what we will sacrifice for Spring to finally come,” continues Loots. “In this instance, and after a two-year lockdown, ‘spring’ is, perhaps, an imagined hope for different and intimate relationships with each other and our world around us.” This production aims to subtly carry its audience to places of deep knowing and awareness. Created in the evolving collaborative creative process, this site-responsive dance work is jointly created by Lliane Loots, Sifiso Khumalo, Jabu Siphika, Mthoko Mkhwanazi, Sbonga Ndlovu, Siseko Duba and Ndumiso Dube. The Cleansing will take place in Durban’s Botanic Gardens from 10 - 24 April. Doors open at 5.30pm and the show starts at 6pm. Bring your own picnic and blanket to the event.
