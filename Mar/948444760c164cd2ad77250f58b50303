The space is currently shared between Valcare (social investment managers), Inceba Trust (Early Childhood Development organisation), Labit (a social entrepreneurship incubator) and Fleet (a local community-minded coffee brand), with more nonprofits booking the hot desks, boardroom and working spaces on-demand. Combined, these organisations save well over R300,000 per year by sharing the office space and other expenses like printers, internet access, coffee, a cleaner and a receptionist.    Besides cost savings, the tenants buy into the greater vision by sharing their ideas, consulting where needed, assisting one another with problem-solving, and speaking at one another's' training events. Corporates urged to extend support to rural NGOs17 Mar 2022Pooled social investments for greater impactMany community projects require significant funding and there aren’t many CSI budgets that can allocate millions to a single capex project. This creates an apt opportunity for social investors to break down the silos and take hands for the sake of a greater cause.Valcare recently assisted with the building of a new facility for Good Hope Day Care Centre for special needs children in Mbekweni in the Western Cape. A total of eight funders joined forces to contribute more than R1.1m needed to make the dream a reality.Multiple other role-players were involved too; including community leaders, local tradesmen, volunteers, government and other nonprofits. Attacq, Sage Foundation partner to bolster child development and education in Tembisa10 Mar 2022Collaboration exposes child trafficking syndicateTo empower nonprofit organisations to be as effective as possible, Valcare facilitates a membership network with more than 250 organisations in the Cape Winelands. To enhance the collaboration amongst nonprofit organisations with similar goals, Valcare created platforms for small groups to gather around specific social impact themes, like Child Protection, Ethics, Food and Nutrition, Women Empowerment, Job Readiness and Skills Development, Sport and Recreation as well as Education Support.  Multiple stories of change have come out of these initiatives since they were initiated. A noteworthy breakthrough happened during one of the Child Protection Coordinated Effort meetings, when leaders from organisations started sharing information about the prevalence of child abuse in the Drakenstein area. They recognised a pattern, and uncovered and exposed a child trafficking syndicate which led to several arrests and safer communities for children. One of the participants of the Education Support Coordinated Effort, Leopold van Velden, the CEO of Thuma Mina Teaching, also confirms that collaborating with other organisations in this way, has led to new opportunities for them, enlarging everyone's footprint in the community.Old Mutual Insure's CSI spend hits R8m10 Mar 2022The only way forward for South AfricaThis might sound candid, but there is absolutely no way that we can make a sustainable social impact in South Africa if we continue in our own separate lanes, trying to make a difference in our own way.There has never been a more pressing time to break down the walls of ownership, protectiveness and entitlement; and join forces to create holistic change together. We have not grown tired of hearing the old African proverb: “If you want to go fast, go alone; but if you want to go far, go together”, and it’s for good reason - the statement is unequivocally true and the only way forward for the social impact space to survive.
