Source: www.pexels.comCofounder of Naked, Ernest North shares three insights about growing a business via positive customer sentiment that could be applied to nearly any industry.  1.	Start by solving a customer problemThere’s plenty of research out there about the power of word of mouth. According to Nielsen research, 83% of online respondents in 60 countries say they trust the recommendations of friends and family, making word-of-mouth the most trusted form of marketing among consumers. A McKinsey study, meanwhile, indicates that word of mouth is the primary factor behind 20% to 50% of all purchasing decisions. But to get that positive customer buzz, a business first needs to impress the customer by solving a problem for them. 2.	Take the bad feedback along with the goodAuthenticity matters when winning a customer’s trust. People can see straight through paid-for or fake positive TV ads or social media reviews. We take the approach of letting real customers do the talking. When a mistake happens and results in negative feedback from a customer, this is an opportunity to learn and make things right.3.	Use reviews as inspirationBecause the users’ experience is core to how we built our company, we are obsessed with listening to customer feedback. It mostly informs our ongoing technology developments as we keep scaling our self-service offering, but occasionally we also use some of the reviews and compliments as inspiration for telling stories about our brand.
