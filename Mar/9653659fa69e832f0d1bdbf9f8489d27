The Econyl Regeneration System starts with rescuing waste from landfills and oceans all over the world. That waste is then sorted and cleaned to recover all the nylon possible through a radical regeneration and purification process.

Econyl regenerated nylon is that it has the potential to be recycled infinitely without ever losing its quality.

Yesterday we commemorated Human Rights Day and were reminded of our rights and responsibilities.  “I believe these are two of the most important days to celebrate. Two days where we can bring to light that every South African has a right to water and sanitation. We also have a responsibility as communities, to preserve and look after our water resources."
