This will be achieved by first identifying opportunities for energy-efficiency improvements, and then funding or part-funding the installation of suitable technology interventions.SAB harnessing waste-to-energy to power sustainable beer brewing10 Mar 2022How can SMEs participate in the programme?Some of the recipient SMEs will be those that have previously participated in an NCPC-SA energy assessment, where alternative energy was identified as a possible solution.
