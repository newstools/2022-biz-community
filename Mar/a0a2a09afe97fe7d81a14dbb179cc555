Set to hit the shops in February of this year, South Africans will soon be able to add a pair of Rock & Co's to their collection. Inspired by the insurgency of alternative and rock culture around the globe, Rock & Co was born out of a desire to be different. South Africa has a large and vibrant alternative culture but few brands to satisfy it. As explained by the lead developer, Tulusa Goncalves, "Rock & Co was fueled by a love for rock, punk, emo and grunge culture. The shoes were designed for concerts, festivals, and markets." When asked about what kind of woman Rock & Co is made for, Gonclaves said, "A Rock & Co woman is someone who is unashamedly proud of who they are. Someone who looks at the world and says, bring it on!"Normal and boring don't apply with Rock & Co. The footwear pushes boundaries and makes statements that other footwear isn't able to. Think combat boots, platform heels, and thick soles. With buckles, studs, zips, and a whole lot of attitude, there's no missing a pair of Rock & Co's.  This winter, you'll be able to buy the fashion footwear brand both in-store and online from retailers like DC.ONE, Superbalist, Takealot, Kingsmead, and Zando. The shoes are positioned to be both trendy and affordable, allowing you to wear the latest styles without breaking the bank.The brand will release four different collections each year: winter, spring, summer, and autumn. To find out more about the brand, you can visit their website https://rockandco.africa.  As a part of the Dangee Carken family, the brand will join the likes of Miss Black, Butterfly Feet, and Urban Art. Rock & Co is, without a doubt, the black sheep of the family. But it is set to become the trendiest new ladies footwear brand in South Africa. Rebels, misfits, rockers, emo-kids, and misunderstood youth, these shoes were made for you. The shoe collection is available in ladies sizes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
