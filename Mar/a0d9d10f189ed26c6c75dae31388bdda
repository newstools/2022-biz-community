For 29 years, EcoTraining has supported this theme by not only being the pioneer and leader in safari and wildlife training in South Africa, but through empowering communities around their camps.Since its inception, EcoTraining has worked closely with the Makuleke community in the Northern section of the Kruger National Park’s Pafuri region. Situated between the Limpopo and the Luvuvhu Rivers, it is an area spanning 24 000ha (59 305 acres).  Within the Pafuri area is the Makuleke Concession, the ancestral home of the Makuleke people and the most diverse and scenically attractive area in the Kruger National Park.“As the only training provider in the Kruger National Park, EcoTraining is looking forward to working more closely with the community of Makuleke this year. For years, this special partnership has allowed us to work with the local people, help them preserve wilderness ecosystems and lease a venue from the community in the Kruger National Park. This has benefited the area’s conservation efforts, the people of Makuleke and the students who have come to learn more about the area, its wildlife and its people,” said managing director Anton Lategan. The Makuleke area is considered to be the wildest and most remote part of the Kruger National Park, offers varied vegetation, great wildlife viewing and the best birding in all of the park. It is filled with folklore of early explorers and ancient civilisations.“We understand the importance of empowering the Makuleke community and we believe that a healthy relationship with the community will ultimately lead to a healthy relationship with nature.  Annually EcoTraining has the opportunity to train members from the Makuleke community to become qualified guides and in 2022, we know this will help a community that has felt the devastating effects of the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Lategan.On World Wildlife Day, EcoTraining will also be celebrating a longstanding relationship with WildEarth TV, a channel which allows the public to watch and engage with expert hosted live interactive safaris from multiple wildlife hotspots throughout Africa. EcoTraining shares content of their own safaris with the channel, which can be watched through DSTV, the WildEarth website as well as social media.      EcoTraining believes that sharing this incredible content, educates the greater public and empowers them to make better choices within the environment they live and play their own part in conservation of wildlife.
