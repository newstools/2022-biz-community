Image supplied: Dune won multiple awards at the 94th Academy Awards In a startling turn of affairs, Will Smith appeared to slap Chris Rock after a joke about Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith. This event overshadowed all the winners and is now the topic of this year’s event – even dwarfing the fact that Will Smith took home the Best Actor award for his role in King Richard. The Best Picture award went to Coda, as well as Best Supporting Actor which was a historic win for Troy Kotsur as the first Deaf man to win an Award for acting, following in his co-star Marlee Matlin’s footsteps who won an Oscar in 1987 for her role in Children of a Lesser God. The film also won the prize for Best Adapted Screenplay.
