Alongside Clockwork’s South African and UK branches bolstering the Inverroche’s wider strategy, the partnership comes off the back of the Inverroche’s recent distribution deal with Pernod Ricard into Africa, as well as plans to widen into European and US distribution channels. Known as one of the most premium luxury gin brands in the country, with sustainability at the heart of the brand, Inverroche combines uniquely South African indigenous botanicals, including fynbos, African sage, sour fig and citrus buchu, to produce a series of organic, homegrown gins that are handcrafted at Inverroche’s exclusive distillery in Still Bay. Inverroche’s products are in tune with many green and responsible sentiments with business values that support sustainable development and social upliftment to create opportunity as well as drive empowerment with just under 70% of employees being indigenous women from the local area. The enterprise is a return to traditional values: handcrafted, community, small batches, authentic and rare.The brand has a purpose-driven focus in 2022 that is supported by a business philosophy where the connection between the planet, people, place, partnerships, and profits collaboratively work together to achieve real life and tangible sustainability.2022 holds a lot of excitement as Inverroche will also introduce the Gin Academy as part of their ‘By Nature’ marketing campaign.
