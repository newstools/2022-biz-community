The awards tracked are determined by a worldwide industry survey and in consultation with the Warc Rankings Advisory Board. Campaign: Crazy Dreams for Nike by Wieden+Kennedy Portland/Publicis Sapient SeattleSportswear brand Nike celebrated its 30th anniversary of the Just Do It campaign by refreshing its original sense of rebellious self-belief.

In second place is A Dad’s Job by FP7 McCann Dubai and Initiative Cairo for Home Centre. The furniture retailer tackled the taboo topic of single mothers to create an impact with its Father's Day campaign in the United Arab Emirates. In third place is Meddle in the New Zealand Election by Special Auckland for Every Kiwi Vote Counts.
