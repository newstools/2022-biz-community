“We are not only passionate about the fantastic work we do, but we believe that Motsepe Advertising will become a catalyst in creating employment opportunities for women and youth,” said Boitumelo Motsepe, co-founder and client service director at Motsepe Advertising.   Since the pandemic, the South African unemployment rate has been increasing, putting much pressure on households, which culminates in poverty, homelessness and, in some severe cases, crime. The Frida Hartley Shelter takes in homeless women and their children who have endured neglect, abuse, trauma and homelessness. An alarming rate of young people are struggling with anxiety and depression, which is rooted in the uncertainties of their futures or, in some extreme cases, survival.   According to founder Cheryl, the shelter houses those individuals who have lost their jobs and are struggling to make ends meet; young homeless mothers looking to kick-start their lives; and individuals going through financial difficulties (affected by retrenchment or unemployment).   Motsepe Advertising is on the journey to becoming a global, black-female-owned agency that is committed to making a superlative change in the advertising and marketing industry across the world, “but this journey starts with us at home, how do we create an impact and value in the lives of our South Africans, while at the same time challenging our clients to also grab onto any opportunity to join us in this quest?" Boitumelo asks.    We are a 60% black-owned (51% black female-owned) agency with a Level 2 B-BBEE certification, and the business believes that we, as of today’s young leaders, need to take as many people as we can to the top.
