However, the traditional financial-services industry lags other sectors in creating opportunities for clients to programme their own banking experience.In response, Investec has launched Programmable Banking, an exclusive functionality for IT professionals, enabling these clients to be at the forefront of innovation in the financial-services sector.By opening an exclusive private bank- or business account, business owners and IT professionals like software developers, -programmers, -engineers, and full-stack and UX engineers can easily activate Programmable Banking on their accounts.“With Programmable Banking, our mission is to accelerate digital-led innovation and offer an out-of-the ordinary experience to business and private banking, while also encouraging growth within the software-developer community,” says Devina Maharaj, program head of Investec Business Online and API Banking.“Tech has become an integral part of all industries, including the finance sector, and virtually every industry needs developers to keep pace with technological advancements and innovation.”Clients can create code and curate their banking serviceBy using an application programming interface (API), clients can access their local Investec account data and transactional information online in real-time and use Programmable Banking to manage transaction activity on any linked Visa cards.“A programmable card account enables a business or private banking client to create code that runs before or after each transaction,” explains Maharaj.Clients can leverage the Investec API to define rules using simple code to approve or decline specific transactions for any Investec Visa Card linked to their account.Clients can also integrate the card with various platforms and internal systems to optimise their businesses processes, with the ability to send transactional data in real-time by means of accounting systems like Sage or Xero, and messaging apps like WhatsApp, email or Slack.“With full access to their card transactions, businesses can track behaviour, integrate and build bespoke notifications, or code specific customised payment limits to create a fully-customised business experience,” continues Maharaj. “Businesses can even use Programmable Banking to control card transactions per merchant or payment category.”Broader applications associated with Programmable Banking will create opportunities for companies and technologists to leverage this data to build new tools and drive new business ventures.The Investec developer community unlocks collaborative problem solving“By launching Programmable Banking, we aim to create opportunities for IT professionals and software developers to solve problems and unlock new possibilities by revolutionising businesses, empowering consumers and uplifting economies,” explains Cumesh Moodliar, head of Investec Private Bank SA.Investec has traditionally focused on building offerings for specific professions and offering this level of customisation to technically-proficient professionals who understand the full power of programmable banking which dovetails perfectly with this strategy.“A key part of Investec’s strategic intent is to bring software engineers and IT professionals on board to help them grow their wealth and unlock new opportunities,” says Moodliar. “We acknowledge their skills and see how IT professionals are fundamentally improving the world and how we operate, engage and transact in it.
