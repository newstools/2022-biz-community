It’s goodies versus baddies, heroes versus villains, the happies versus the horrids - and you’ll be there with us to conquer greed and recapture the glow of goodness in Pantoland”.Image supplied: Pinocchio production from 2017The cast this year will feature Dylan Du Plessis, David Arnold Johnson, Didintle Khunou, Ilse Klink, Hlengiwe Lushaba Madlala, Carmen Pretorius, Brenda Sakellarides, Justin Swartz, Grant Towers and Ben Voss.Dancing, singing and playing every other role in the panto ensemble will be triple-threat performers Louise Duhain, Tarryn Heard, Elsje Lourens, Gareth Meijsen, Katlego Nche, René Setlhako, Thandaza Silwane, Jordan Soares, Logan Timbre, Kensiwe Tshabalala, Stephan Van Der Walt and Donovan Yaards.Image supplied: Production of Pinocchio from 2017Coming together again from Joburg Theatre’s hugely successful 2021 pantomime Cinderella, the creative team for Adventures in Pantoland includes production designer Andrew Timm, choreographer Nicol Sheraton, musical director Dale-Ray Scheepers, costume co-ordinator Bronwen Lovegrove and lighting designer Johan Ferreira.Tickets from R260 are available here or by calling 0861 670 670.
