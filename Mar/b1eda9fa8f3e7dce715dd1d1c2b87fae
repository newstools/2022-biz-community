PRS results enable BioCertica to provide clients with a much higher resolution DNA result than was previously available in the market, increasing the level of accuracy when determining genetic predisposition to conditions like high blood pressure, gluten sensitivity, obesity and heart diseases, as well as determining individual genetic incline towards optimal vitamin D levels, cholesterol levels, sleeping habits, etc. This technological advancement will enable African healthcare practitioners to gain deeper insights into their patients' genetics through the BioCertica Practitioners Platform, advancing preventative care and precision medicine. BioCertica is a user's-privacy-centred genetic testing platform launched in August 2020. BioCertica raised $650k in pre-seed funding round and will launch a $1.6m seed round during March 2022. The lead investor of the pre-seed round and technology partner, Ministry of Programming (MOP - ranked on the Financial Times FT1000 list of Europe's fastest-growing companies), built and developed bespoke genetic pipelines suited for the African market. BioCertica displays a user's customised genetic results on a built-for-purpose application available on all major app stores.
