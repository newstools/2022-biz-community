The proclamation of 14 March as the International Day of Mathematics (IDM) was adopted by the 40th General Conference of UNESCO in November 2019, and this year will be celebrated under the theme "Mathematics Unites".“The Soweto Science Centre is excited to partner on this event, as this highlights our contribution to celebrating the essential role that Mathematics plays in Science, Technology and Innovation, says Dr Lungile Sitole, UJ SSC Director.New YouTube seriesIn this joint venture with the National Institute for Theoretical and Computational Sciences (NITheCS), NRF South African Agency for Science and Technology Advancement (SAASTA); South African Mathematics Foundation (SAMF); South African Mathematical Society (SAMS); and the Northcliff Rotary Club (NRC) have organised online activities on mathematics and will launch a YouTube series aimed at school and undergraduate students.“Our YouTube series initiative will deliver exciting and enticing content centered around mathematical research in South Africa and the world. The 'Meet a Mathematician' series will showcase South African mathematicians and their stories and inspire students to pursue the study of mathematics,” says Dr Cerene Rathilal, Pure Mathematician and lecturer at UJ.“Students will have the opportunity to win UJ merchandise and e-vouchers by participating in quizzes and the photo challenge at our UJ IDM event,” added Dr Rathilal.Photo competitionThe new feature of IDM 2022 is the Photo Challenge. Students can participate in the challenge by submitting their photo with mathematics to moc.liamg@22mdiju. Last year, the International Mathematical Union launched the poster challenge to which more than 2,100 schools and organisations responded, producing their own IDM poster to illustrate one facet of the theme of “Mathematics for a Better World”. “As the basis of all sciences, and the basis on which our financial system is centred, mathematics is a vital subject for all students. The improved understanding of maths and its usage will benefit not only the students but our society as a whole,” explains Robert Jacobzs, President of the Northcliff Rotary Club.High school learners and undergraduates interested in participating at the IDM on 19 March 2022 can register via: https://bit.ly/3s6TrQH
