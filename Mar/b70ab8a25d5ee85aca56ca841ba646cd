It aims to leverage the power of digital to create spaces that enable young poets across oceans to speak, learn and grow together. Additionally, it supports and builds capacity for local organisations for sustained impact. Poetry will be used as the vehicle to drive conversations around human rights between young people from Europe and South Africa, using various hybrid events and co-productions.
