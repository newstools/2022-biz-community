How being active can help ease muscle soreness and stiffnessThe recommended treatment for muscle soreness and stiffness for many years included rest and inactivity. However, exercise may have specific benefits in reducing pain as well as more generic benefits associated with improved overall physical health.3Exercise improves cardiorespiratory fitness and cardiovascular health, increases muscle mass and strength, and improves joint mobility and physical functioning.4Exercise may also produce changes in the brain that can significantly reduce pain. Exercise appears to stimulate brain regions involved in descending pain inhibitions, decreasing their sensitivity to pain.5 Finally, exercise appears to have effects on mental health, such as mood elevation and reduction of stress and depression, which are often associated with pain conditions.6Keep muscle soreness and stiffness at bayExercise can be any physical activity. It could be running, swimming, tennis, or bowls, or it could be an exercise training programme or a hobby like cycling or strolling. It could also involve physical hobbies like gardening, cleaning, or going for a walk to the store.7Keep in mind that when starting a new exercise programme, the best approach is to begin with small amounts of physical activity and gradually increase pace and duration.Stretching makes many individuals feel better during and after exercise, and it helps some people reduce muscle discomfort and stiffness. Following a workout, a cool-down period helps your breathing and heart rate to return to normal. By circulating blood to the exercised muscles, it can also aid in the healing process and potentially relieve delayed onset muscular soreness.8How CBD can help boost your pre and post workoutThe purest form of CBD, CBD isolate, is known for its anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving properties.9Studies have reported that CBD isolate may assist with reducing pain, inflammation, and overall discomfort, without causing psychomotor slowing or dependence.10   Adco CBD Pain gel11, available in a convenient pump bottle, is formulated with various ingredients that work together to assist with symptomatic relief of muscle pain, inflammation, minor sprains, and strains post workout.The formulation also includes Methyl sulphonyl methane (MSM), menthol, wintergreen essential oil (Methyl Salicylate), arnica oil, clove bud oil, and rosemary oil.11Other Adco CBD pain12 management productsIn addition to Adco CBD Pain gel, both Adco CBD Pain drops and Adco CBD Pain capsules are free from THC and sugar, and each batch is laboratory tested and quality controlled to ensure that you get the highest quality CBD at the right dose.Adco CBD Pain drops and Adco CBD Pain capsules contain CBD isolate and assist with relief of symptoms associated with minor pain.
