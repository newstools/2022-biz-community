Samantha Coom, founder and CEO of The Social Craft.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Could you briefly explain what your role entails?CEO and founder- where does it even start and end? As the leader of a startup digital agency, I have found myself being the creative director, chief revenue officer and head of administration all in one day. However, ultimately this means I am a leader of an international business that’s using digital marketing to empower Africans to connect to the world. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What’s really behind your mask - literally and figuratively speaking?A fierce personality, a big heart, a creative mind, a wide smile and Lipstick MAC shade Teddy. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Growing up, what did you want to be?When asking my mom, she reminded me it wasn’t a simple answer, but I believe the most consistent answer was a shopkeeper or a handbag designer. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How did you end up in the industry?I started my career thinking I would be a copywriter in the consumer advertising world. Writing radio adverts for Smirnoff and planning the event concept and rollout for the J&B Met. Very quickly I realised my passion wasn’t in the creative consumer-orientated chaos and decided to use my skills to venture into the corporate world as a communications specialist within HR. Using my combination of copywriting, conceptual thinking, creative development and the love for digital I used those skills to grow and develop my brand within the industry. Fast forward nearly 10 years- here we are. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}When you founded The Social Craft, what did you hope to achieve?I wanted to make a difference through digital and creativity. The business, built for an employer and corporate brand development and amplification on credible business channels like LinkedIn - this all for me is about levelling the playing field for talent and giving those that otherwise wouldn’t have the visibility to build their career, a chance - digitally. From both aspects, I wanted to empower businesses to transform their recruiting strategies that put more of Africa’s talent on the map and I wanted more people that would not normally be visible to employers to have a head start when they otherwise potentially wouldn’t..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What has the journey been like?They say great things never come from your comfort zone. My whole life I have liked to think of myself as a high performer and achiever in the workplace - this has challenged me like never before! I have also built a totally remote team that operate between Dublin and South Africa- so the journey of navigating time difference has also been an interesting one. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What excites you most about your career?The ability to make an impact on people’s lives. Not by selling them a product or service through creativity, digital and marketing but by meaningfully connecting people in our communities to economic opportunity through propelling careers in Africa. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What has been the highlight of your career?If you had asked me two years ago - it probably would have been relocating to Dublin for my dream job - LinkedIn. Now that I am here, I would say the highlight has been being able to actually create economic opportunity in my business through hiring and building my own team and not just through empowering our clients to do so. Starting from one, we are now at an employee count of six in just over a year. That to me I think is the biggest highlight. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}When you're not busy working, what do you do? How do you socialise these days?We’re very lucky that Dublin and Europe are now opening up so I feel like travel is back on the cards- something I really have missed over the last 18 months. I also spend my time consulting on other passion projects in between a game or two of tennis (when the weather allows). .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are you watching/reading/listening to at the moment?I am hooked on the podcast series Diary of a CEO by Steven Bartlett. He interviews international thought leaders from social, politics, lifestyle and sport. The people who range from Jay Shetty, James Smith, Dr Jordan B Peterson to Molly Mae all cater to such diverse, meaningful topics we’re all dealing with in some way, every day. f.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What does 2022 have in store for you?Hopefully loads of travel into Africa - a continent that lights my soul on fire. I know next month we’re embarking on a business trip to Uganda, Kenya and Rwanda to present at a digital HR conference and to meet the clients we so frequently connect with over video comms. I am also turning 30 this year - so hopefully some time off the grid to connect and celebrate with those (near and far) that have been so key on my journey so far.
