The acquisition also means that Dis-Chem Baby City’s sponsorship of the MamaMagic Baby Expo has been refreshed to include an even wider range of products and services, including a Baby Clinic within their pop-up store at the expo. The Dis-Chem Baby City store will comprise a wide range of exhibitors from clothing, travel systems and baby monitors to breast pumps. The Baby Clinic will be an added benefit to visitors at the expo. This sponsorship by Dis-Chem Baby City adds even greater value to all families attending the MamaMagic expo, so be sure to save the date and attend the expo. Since 2005, MamaMagic has been a trusted facilitator and guide for moms and dads in their parenting journey, and the reopening of this popular expo is eagerly anticipated by moms and dads across the country.“Dis-Chem strives to offer its consumer a service that meets their needs; a full in-store experience. With Baby City now part of our group offering, we will do the same both in-store and at the expos. The partnership with the MamaMagic Baby Expo is a crucial platform for engaging with our consumers and giving them a refreshed experience of our pop-up store nationally,” said Ronald Govender, head of FMCG at Dis-Chem.Attendees at the MamaMagic Baby Expos can look forward to a host of exhibitor offerings, not-to-be-missed expo specials, refreshing live entertainment, expert parenting advice, must-enter competitions, and VIP goodie bags to make their shopping experience that much more rewarding. These exhibitions mark the safe return to in-person events for the community and provide an unmissable opportunity for parenting brands to engage with this valuable sector in person.“MamaMagic Baby Expo has always been the ideal occasion for parents to ‘test-drive’ products, take advantage of one-off specials, experience innovation, and feel part of a community. Being locked out of these opportunities has left parents with an even deeper desire for these experiences. Brands exhibiting at MamaMagic have the opportunity to connect with a targeted audience who are yearning for engagement,” commented Warren Murray, MamaMagic brand director.Visitor safety and security are of utmost importance, and adherence to Covid-19 protocols, including the mandatory use of face masks, adequate sanitisation, and commitment to maximum capacity guidelines, will be strictly enforced.Save the date and book your stand now by emailing az.oc.cigamamam@selas7-10 April 2022 – Gallagher Convention Centre, Johannesburg29 July – 31 July 2022 – Durban Expo Centre, Durban28 October – 30 October 2022 – Cape Town International Convention Centre, Cape Town1 December – 4 December 2022 – Gallagher Convention Centre, Johannesburg
