Furthermore, those brands have solid plans in place to take full advantage of the strong tailwinds and favourable consumer trends in the home furnishings sector.“Lead indicators for this sector include listings of homes for sale, with around 400,000 currently up for sale on top online portals, and actual sales of around 50,000 a month. This creates multiple homeware and furnishings opportunities – in the kitchen, bedrooms, living rooms, and outdoor spaces,” said Thunström.Thunström added, “Beyond their own robust growth plans and the potential to roll out more store footprint, one particular example being the Volpes business, we see further opportunities to grow these businesses by integrating them into our TFG e-commerce ecosystem, with our 26 million-strong customer base, and adding credit facilities to their offering, while augmenting the local manufacturing capability of the TFG group.”TFG snaps up SA startup Quench3 Dec 2021Investment in homeware and local manufacturing capabilityThunström said TFG remained confident and committed to investing in South Africa despite the July unrest and rioting of last year.Shani Naidoo, TFG group director for the Homeware Division, added “We are delighted to have reached agreement on the acquisition and look forward to bringing our consumers more choice and customisation across the TFG stable, as we bring our scale to bear in growing the Tapestry businesses.“This R2.35bn investment in our homeware and local manufacturing capability is strongly aligned to the government’s furniture masterplan. We will continue to work to support Minister Patel’s plan to grow employment, develop skills and reindustrialise the sector. Our intention is to grow the Tapestry brands aggressively and thereby create new jobs in the business.“The Tapestry group and its management team have implemented a unique, highly cash generative business model with excellent historic returns. The highly regarded management team, headed up by former Nando’s South Africa managing director Kevin Utian, will continue in their roles to ensure continuity. The ability to increase capacity and improve profitability with limited further capital expenditure was an attractive proposition for TFG,” said Naidoo.Hopes of recovery for SA furniture manufacturers as retailers expand local sourcing10 Dec 2021Martin Sacks, executive chairman of Westbrooke Group, which is the lead shareholder of Tapestry Home Brands, said the company had an excellent management team and could not have wished for a better home than TFG.
