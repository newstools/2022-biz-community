Placing the foundation for a lifelong learning relationship with False Bay TVET College, Lwandile still today has access to opportunities for greater learning and personal growth. Today Lwandile is a proud business owner and beneficiary of the Centre for Entrepreneurship/Rapid Incubator (CfE), for business growth support. Humble beginnings, Lwandile started his business in June 2020 from his home garage. This happened after six years of employment, when he was sadly retrenched due to Covid-19 pandemic. Fortunately, Lwandile’s plans to start his own business was already underway and he was able to open his doors to service the local community within a short period of time. Lwandile offers printing, IT support, graphic design services and supports other small businesses and NGO with business services and registrations. With his IT qualification achieved, entrepreneurship support from the CfE, Lwandile understands to grow his business; he would need to refine his business and employer knowledge. Lwandile has recently graduated from the EBL – Entrepreneurship Business Literacy Institute - for the New Venture Creation course accredited by University of Free State, coached by the number-one ActionCOACH in Africa – Dr Thabo Pitse. He has also attended other business programmes to ensure he reaches his goal to franchise and diversify in his service offerings with a special focus on youth development and IT training.
