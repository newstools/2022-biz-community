Staging a gala event also signals our confidence in the ability of the local entertainment industry to begin its recovery after the enormous setbacks brought on by the pandemic.” The awards presentation will include a stage, live entertainment, wine and gourmet food pods. “Traditionally, our gala occasion would have been at either the Artscape or Baxter, but we’re excited to be moving to such a beautiful venue to accommodate the social distancing protocols demanded by Covid. The new format makes for an easier flow between people as they reconnect,” says Melane.  Fleur du Cap Theatre Awards winners announced9 Nov 2021Nominees have been identified in 19 categories this year. Melane explains that while virtually the full spectrum of categories has returned, there had to be a slight adjustment. “This year, the categories for performance in plays has been merged with those in musicals and music shows. The panel took this decision because of the limited number of musicals mounted in 2020 and 2021. As a panel, we applaud members of the performing arts community for their courage in mounting productions under very trying and difficult times. With no income to support themselves and often limited opportunity to exercise their talents or to rehearse, it is admirable that they could continue to look ahead and maintain such resolute optimism.” Image supplied: The ProducersTracey Saunders, who is convenor of the Fleur du Cap Theatre Awards’ student panel, adds, “It’s been another unprecedented academic year for students during 2021, and yet, they showed again how the creative spirit remains unbowed. From the monologue staged by a student completing her post-graduate degree to small groups of students rehearsing in isolation before coming together on stage for a breath-taking performance of Cats, their work continued. In small ways and large gestures students and lecturers supported each other through the twilight world of Covid academia and created magic in their virtual and physical classrooms which they shared despite all obstacles.” Human Rights focused productions at Artscape for March3 Mar 2022On 27 March, the evening of the awards event, one winner or winning team will be identified within each category. The winners of the Innovation in Theatre Award and Lifetime Achievement Award will also be announced at the awards ceremony.
