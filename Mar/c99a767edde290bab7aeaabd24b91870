#wombstories won top campaign for 2022Compiled by Warc, the international marketing insights company, the Creative 100 Ranking is produced by combining the results of the industry’s most important global and regional creative award shows tracked throughout 2021. The awards tracked are determined by a worldwide industry survey and in consultation with the Warc Rankings Advisory Board.Campaign: #wombstoriesThe most creatively celebrated campaign of 2021, #wombstories for feminine hygiene brand Bodyform/Libresse/Libra used the power of storytelling to embrace the complexity and reality of womanhood. Whilst heartbreaking, the campaign by AMV BBDO London is designed to tackle taboos and make women proud of their bodies.Nicholas Hulley and Nadja Lossgott, chief creative officers, AMV BBDO, said, “Wombstories has been our most profound and complex undertaking – both emotionally and technically. Daring to listen and dive into the darker side of people’s experiences with their wombs and wrestling an octopus of a campaign with so many arms that all had to live up to our ambition of creativity and empathy. But complexity is worth it, to leave millions of people feeling understood and, in many cases, reach out to each other to finally share their womb stories.” In second place is True Name for Mastercard by McCann New York. The campaign demonstrated its support for the LGBTQIA+ community in the USA by launching the first payment product where people could feature their chosen name on their card. Third, is Donation Dollar, a campaign for Royal Australian Mint by Saatchi & Saatchi Melbourne, whereby a donation coin was created to support charities.Creative Agency: Publicis MilanUp from third place last year, crowning agency Publicis Milan has four campaigns in the top 100: for Diesel (x2), Heineken and Barilla. AMV BBDO London follows closely behind with two campaigns, one for Macmillan Cancer support as well as the highest-ranked #wombstories. Africa São Paulo is in third place with four campaigns for House of Lapland, SporTV, Folha de SP and Associação Brasileira de Psiquiatria.Bruno Bertelli, global chief creative officer, Publicis Worldwide, said, “Being ranked number 1 Agency of the Year in the Warc Creative 100 Ranking is testament to hard work, a proven model of data and creativity and the bravery of our people and clients. We continue to push each other to go further and be better and it is paying off. Congratulations to everyone at Publicis Italy.”Creative Network: OgilvyRetaining its top spot for a second consecutive year is Ogilvy, with four agencies in the top 50 contributing points to its total, including David Miami and David Madrid both ranked in the top five. Publicis Worldwide and DDB Worldwide follow in second and third place respectively.Liz Taylor, global chief creative officer, Ogilvy, said, “It's thrilling to be named the most creative network in the world by Warc. Earning this designation for the second consecutive year speaks to the hard work and dedication of our teams across the globe who continuously deliver unforgettable ideas that have an impact for our clients. This accomplishment is also a testament to the borderless creativity that unites our network across geographies, capabilities, and cultures.

Bodyform/Libresse/Libra follows in second place, and Mastercard is in third, up from #25 last year.Advertiser: AB InBevBrewing giant AB InBev, which has steadily climbed the Creative 100 Rankings over the past few years, takes the top spot this year. Restaurant Brands International drops to second and Unilever climbs to third place up from seventh last year.Pedro Earp, chief marketing officer, AB InBev, said, “We are humbled to be ranked number one in creativity.

This transformation has defined AB InBev by its creative excellence, strategic boldness and accelerated innovation.

The UK remains second and France moves up to claim third place.Summing up, David Tiltman, SVP, content, Warc, said, “The top campaigns from the Creative 100 Ranking show how marketers are increasingly trying to highlight untold stories. Many give a voice to sections of society that may not have been properly represented in the past - for example, #wombstories and The Bread Exam focus on women's health and the conversations around it. We've also seen campaigns addressing the LGBTQIA+ community’s need for individual recognition, amplifying the voices of Black youth, and showing the danger that Mexican journalists face daily. All explored important issues that have historically been ignored.”Most awarded campaigns for creativityRankCampaign TitleBrandAgenciesPoints#1#wombstoriesBodyform/Libresse/LibraAMV BBDO London194.9#2True NameMastercardMcCann New York147.1#3Donation DollarRoyal Australian MintSaatchi & Saatchi Melbourne130.7#4CourtsideMichelob UltraFCB New York115.1#5#StillSpeakingUp DeepTruthPropuesta CívicaPublicis Riga / Publicis Mexico City110.7#6You Love MeBeats by Dr DreTranslation New York101.9#7Shutter AdsHeinekenPublicis Milan99.3#8Stay Home Miles ExchangeThai AirwaysWunderman Thompson Bangkok98.7#9Moldy WhopperBurger KingINGO Stockholm / DAVID Miami / Publicis Bucharest93.2#10The Bread ExamSpinneys/Lebanese Breast Cancer Foundation/American University of Beirut Medical CenterMcCann Paris / FP7 McCann Dubai / McCann Health London / FP7 McCann Beirut / McCann Frankfurt89.6Most awarded agencies for creativityRankAgencyPoints#1Publicis Milan261.5#2AMV BBDO London252.2#3Africa São Paulo207.8#4DAVID Miami168.7#5DAVID Madrid160.5#6FCB New York156.9#7McCann New York147.1#8FCB Chicago143.9#9R/GA San Francisco136.4#10Saatchi & Saatchi Melbourne133.6Most awarded networks for creativityRankNetworkPoints#1Ogilvy745.2#2Publicis Worldwide657#3DDB Worldwide630.1#4BBDO Worldwide585#5McCann Worldgroup564#6FCB484.2#7TBWA Worldwide342.4#8Havas Creative Group330.8#9Wunderman Thompson315#10Saatchi & Saatchi296.9Most awarded holding companies for creativityRankHolding companyPoints#1Omnicom Group1625.6#2WPP1462#3Interpublic Group1418.8#4Publicis Group1342.2#5Havas Group357.5#6Accenture241#7Dentsu198.1#8Hakuhodo DY Group130.9#9Stagwell73.7#10Blue Focus21.6Most awarded brands for creativityRankBrandPoints#1Burger King408#2Bodyform/Libresse/Libra194.9#3Mastercard180#4Michelob Ultra156.9#5Reddit136.4#6Heineken135.8#7Royal Australian Mint130.7#8McDonald's124.4#9Nike116.6#10Propuesta Cívica110.7Most awarded advertisers for creativityRankAdvertiserPoints#1AB InBev555#2Restaurant Brands International434.2#3Unilever253.2#4Essity198.5#5Mastercard180#6Apple178.2#7Government of Australia154.3#8Heineken140#9Reddit136.4#10Nike131.5Most awarded countries for creativityRankCountryPoints#1USA2451.1#2United Kingdom812.2#3France413.3#4Brazil410.4#5Australia370.4#6Spain354.6#7Italy301.5#8United Arab Emirates285.9#9Mexico264.7#10South Africa253.5
