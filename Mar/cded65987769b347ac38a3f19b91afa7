Sourced from The Cricketer: Shane WarneWarne was known to be arguably the greatest leg-spinner of all time. He was 52 years old. He died while in Koh Samui, after suffering a suspected heart attack. According to Warne’s management team, he was found unresponsive in his villa and the medical staff were unable to revive him. Cannot believe it. One of the greatest spinners, the man who made spin cool, superstar Shane Warne is no more. Life is very fragile, but this is very difficult to fathom. My heartfelt condolences to his family, friends and fans all around the world. pic.twitter.com/f7FUzZBaYX— Virender Sehwag (@virendersehwag) March 4, 2022Behind Muttiah Muralitharan (who had 800 wickets), Warne is the second-highest wicket-taker in test cricket history with 708 wickets.
