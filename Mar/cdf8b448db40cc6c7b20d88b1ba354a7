Compiled by Warc, the Media 100 is produced by combining the results of the industry’s most important global and regional media award shows tracked throughout 2021. The awards tracked are determined by a worldwide industry survey and in consultation with the Warc Rankings Advisory Board. Campaign: Undercover Avatar for L’Enfant Bleu by Havas Sports and Entertainment ParisFrench child welfare association L’Enfant Bleu harnessed the power of Fortnite, the hugely popular video game, by creating an undercover in-game avatar enabling children to confide their concerns about abuse during lockdown. The impact of the campaign resulted in the French government working on solutions to turn video games into new ways to identify abused children. In second place is Dogvertising for Pedigree by MediaCom Zagreb and Go2Digital Zagreb. The campaign delivered personalised advertising by DOOH technology based on dog detection. In third is Media That 'Eats' Pollution for Volkswagen by PHD London. To launch VW’s first fully-electric vehicle, the ID.3, they painted OOH ads using a unique air purifying paint.  Media Agency: MediaCom New YorkWith five highly placed campaigns in the top 100 for Ally, Uber, Walgreens and Duracell, MediaCom New York has stormed up the rankings to claim global pole position. Mindshare Shanghai is in second place with eight campaigns ranked. PHD London rises to third place, up from 40th, with two campaigns, including Media That ‘Eats’ Pollution ranked third.  Sasha Savic, CEO of MediaCom US, said, "Topping the Warc Media 100 is a defining moment for MediaCom U.S., and we could not be more honoured for the recognition.Delivering transformative campaigns is all down to our amazing people working with some of the most ambitious marketers in the world. I am most proud that the #1 ranking comes from wins across our breadth of expertise, whether data creativity, content partnerships, gaming, or social impact. My sincerest thanks to every person at MediaCom in the US, our clients, and our partners. This one is all yours."  Media Network: MindshareFor a second consecutive year, taking top place is Mindshare, with seven agencies in the top 50 contributing to its tally of points. Hot on its heels and closing the points gap is MediaCom in second place and PHD Worldwide is in third, up from fourth. Adam Gerhart, global CEO of Mindshare, said, “The Warc 100 isn’t just about a single awards show or one campaign - it’s a celebration of being the best of the best and we’re delighted to be recognised as the most creative media network in the world for the third year running! We couldn’t do it without the unwavering energy of our teams and the liberating collaboration of our partners and clients, so thank you to everyone for helping us to continue to create media experiences that have an impact and change the world.”  No change for the top three networks for the past five years, with WPP retaining its pole position, Omnicom Group in second place and Interpublic Group in third.  Brand: L’Enfant BleuNewcomer to the Warc Rankings, French child welfare association L’Enfant Bleu is the top brand with its outstanding and impactful campaign Undercover Avatar. Pedigree is in second place following a three-year absence from the top 50. Online US bank Ally enters the top 50 brands for the first time in the third position.  Pauline Grison, communications director of L’Enfant Bleu, said, “L'Enfant Bleu is very proud to be #1 brand and #1 campaign in the Warc Media 100 Rankings with "Undercover Avatar"! More than a communication campaign, this device allowed us to come into contact with hundreds of children in danger in less than a month. After this period, we were much more visible in the media and had a 200% increase in calls from witnesses of child abuse. This honour is therefore really symbolic for all these children.” Advertiser: UnileverMultinational consumer goods company Unilever retains its number one spot for the third consecutive year. Brewing giant AB InBev, moves up one place to second. The Government of New Zealand, which has steadily climbed the Media 100 Rankings over the past couple of years, is now in third place.  Conny Braams, chief digital and marketing officer of Unilever, said, “It’s excellent to see Unilever featured in the top three of both the Warc Media 100 and Creative 100 Rankings. Retaining the number one spot in media excellence for the third year in a row is a testament to the world-leading expertise of our Global Media team and agency partners, who seamlessly navigate a dynamic media landscape to build brands and drive conversion at the same time.” Country: USANo change in the top three from last year, with USA retaining its #1 ranking, followed by the UK in second place and China in third. Warc rankings for Creative 100 released1 day agoSumming up, David Tiltman, SVP, Content, Warc, said, “The Warc Media 100 shows the growing influence of gaming on the media landscape. More clients are showing an understanding of the nuances of gaming beyond simple product placement or ads in games. Top campaign L'Enfant Bleu created an avatar within video game Fortnite that allowed children at risk of abuse to talk in confidence without their parent's knowledge, and Ally Bank created a virtual island within the Animal Crossing game and created its own 'turnip exchange' to demonstrate its ‘smarter way to bank’ credentials to Millennials.” The Warc Media 100 has been compiled by applying a rigorous, unbiased and transparent methodology.
