Wits' Enrico Pescivolo, a regional winner in the 2022 Corobrik Student Architecture AwardsHe receives a R10,000 prize and the opportunity to compete in the national awards where the top title will be awarded, along with a R70,000 grand prize.Entitled ‘Obsoles[s]ence: Recharting humanity’s relationship with technology through the adaptive reuse of the Kelvin Power Station’, Pescivolo’s thesis aims to transform the symbolism of the power station from “that of environmental destruction and the flawed modern technological attitude towards a symbol of innovation and recharted technological attitudes for the future, building off of the errors of the past”. This idea is reinforced, dealing with decommissioned power stations when considering their adaptive reuse as the end of an era of obsolete technology and attitudes birthing the beginning of a new.Commenting on his win, Pescivolo says: “I am deeply honoured and excited to contribute towards the dialogue of architecture and its role in tackling global issues. Outside of industry recognition and exposure, I am excited to share my thinking broadly to take my ideas outside of competing to actively participate in creating spaces that have meaning to its immediate users as well as its symbolism.“As I see it, competing in the Corobrik Student Architecture Awards national round is exciting, but the opportunity to contribute beyond the finals excites me to feel part of a collaborative effort that affects all of humanity. Additionally, I am honoured to be part of a diversity of thinking outside of the themes and issues of my own work as presented by other regional winners.”UJ's Linda Lesolle takes regional win in 2022 Corobrik Student Architecture Awards24 Mar 202235th Corobrik Architectural Student of the Year Awards - University of the Witwatersrand:Winner: Enrico Pescivolo, R10,000Joint Runner-up: Ural Chetty, R7,000Joint Runner-up: Mahdiyah Thokan, R7,000Best Use of Clay Masonry: Philisani Nkqeto, R6,000
