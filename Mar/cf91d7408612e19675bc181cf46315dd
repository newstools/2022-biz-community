Basketball has great potential locally and we are looking forward to celebrating the spirit of the game together with the community.” Image supplied: The Zoo Lake basketball courtBlending urban culture and cognac, the court design draws inspiration from the diverse, indigenous craft techniques of the Southern regions of Africa whilst also celebrating the vibrancy and talent of its people. Featuring a sun at its centre, the warmth of the continent is depicted alongside ripple patterns to mimic the flow of the Charente River in Cognac, which played an integral role in the historical success of the brand.  In the court design, Nyoni makes use of the iconic ‘Bras Armé’ symbol subtly redesigned to integrate the NBA partnership with basketball in hand. The robust colours showcased throughout the design represent the energy of both the game and more importantly Africa, and the creative beat of the African people.

I’m honoured to have collaborated with Hennessy on this project to create a space where people can enjoy themselves together as a community.” The Zoo Lake court opened its doors to the public on 12 March 2022.
