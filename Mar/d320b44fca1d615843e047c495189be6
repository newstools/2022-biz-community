Having successfully taken the judging sessions online in the past two years, the Immortal Awards is delighted to be returning to in-person jury days in October and November to decide 2022’s winners.The Immortal Awards once again expanded the competition in 2021, with a number of country-based jury days feeding into the regional juries that were introduced in 2020. These local juries, which included days dedicated to the USA, Canada, the UK, Ireland, Germany and a combined Australia-New Zealand jury, will be returning this year, with the addition of more local juries to be announced over the coming months.The best work from these initial rounds, as decided by the local juries, will qualify for the respective regional competition alongside the best work from the rest of the region. A series of regional jury days, for each of North America, Latin America, Europe, Middle East & Africa and Asia Pacific, will then determine which projects receive Finalist status and qualify for the final, global round of judging. Matt Cooper, CEO of Little Black Book, says: “We are really pleased that this year we add no more categories to The Immortal Awards. We are still category free but each year we get more, different types of work from many more countries, which leads to deeper discussion in the jury room with a jury that crosses the industry. As ever, a huge thank you must go to our partners for their support, as without them we simply wouldn’t be able to do what we do.”Paul Monan, awards director, says: “We’re incredibly excited for this year’s competition - already our fifth - and can’t wait to get back on the road at the end of this year to judge together, in-person with exceptional creative minds from across the world. The Immortals has grown rapidly in our first few years of competition, with more work from more companies in more countries being submitted each year. Our plan is to continue growing the show to become the World Cup of Advertising, with a jury in each country fighting for the very best work to represent that market within its region and, hopefully, globally.”Entries into The Immortal Awards will be accepted until 9 September 2022. All entries must be made for a commissioning client, and must have first aired, broadcast, displayed, launched or published between 1 September 2021 and 31 August 2022.
