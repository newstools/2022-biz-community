It has since moved to finance vehicles for logistics and deliveries."The business has just been phenomenal. From the demand side it has just been exponential since launch, pretty much every single month we have grown 50% month-on-month," he told Reuters.Moove secures $10m funding from NBK2 Feb 2022Moove is operating in six cities in Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya and South Africa.Its expansion will see Moove extending financing to buses, trucks and three-wheelers and is expected to maintain the same level of growth this year, said Delano.On a continent where the majority of people are still unbanked, fintech startups are emerging to disrupt how lending has been done by traditional banks, which demand collateral that many African people and small businesses do not have.Moove's latest funding was led by existing investors, Speedinvest, Left Lane Capitals and new participation from others like AfricInvest and Kreos Capital.The company said in a statement that it plans to have at least 30% of the vehicles it finances to be electric by next year and at least half of its customers to be women in future.
