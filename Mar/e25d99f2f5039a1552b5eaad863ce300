With the six trees taking root at the school offering a shade for learners, Konica Minolta South Africa is poised to change the outlook of the school. “It’s such a privilege for us to be able to take part in this greening project,” said school principal, Mrs Betsi Schoeman. “We know that the conducive environment created by planting trees will have a wonderfully positive effect on our children.” Small efforts, big resultsMany more children and community members are set to benefit from the plantings which will take place at 19 more schools and four community organisations. In fact, the 1,020 trees to be planted in total will have a significant impact on the city as a whole, helping to offset 376.38 CO2e throughout their lifetime. The company has, to date, donated 59,339 trees in locations throughout the country, offsetting 21,896.31 tCO2e in the process. The project represents an ongoing effort to green the country, in line with Konica Minolta’s belief that continued small efforts make the world of difference in benefiting nature.

Given the trials that all South Africans experienced during the past two pandemic years, this is something that we can all value.”
