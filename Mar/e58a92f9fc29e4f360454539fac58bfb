We’ll guide you to understand the new market and why we believe NFTs have a massive part to play in the future of financial investing.”The unique collaboration of art, chocolate and NFTs1 day agoThis new digital asset class has value due to the blistering pace of the digitalisation of our world.Millennials and Gen Z especially have digital lives and it’s natural to want to take digital representations of fashion brands, music, and art into these worlds - and now they can with NFTs.Already one key focus for NFT collectors around the world is sports with major brands, including Formula 1 and the NBA, involved in the marketplace.“We’re excited to drop our own collection of Sport NFTs.
