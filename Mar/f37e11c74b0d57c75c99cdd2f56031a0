Meet Zorora, a Cape Town based furniture brand. Zorora, a Shona word meaning rest, believes that good furniture should not cost the earth and production should be kept local. “The economic challenges facing South Africa coupled with the mass disruption to global supply chains has opened opportunities for Zorora to make an impact in this space, '' says Matthew van der Westhuizen, digital marketing manager at Zorora.“Zorora uses modern manufacturing technology and equipment to achieve high quality furniture that is both exclusive and beautiful,” comments Van der Westhuizen. It’s this approach to furniture manufacture that sees occasional chairs, sofas and ottomans being sold to the public at amazing prices, without compromising on quality.Consumers will be able to shop a selection that includes 2–3 seater sofas solutions and L-shaped couches in on trend colours and fabrics. Each style is produced in a small run to eliminate waste and to ensure that Zorora can innovate and update styles regularly.Based in Woodstock, the business is nimble and able to respond to trends and its customers’ needs quickly, without incurring massive costs which are passed on to the customer.“The benefits and opportunities for re-invigoration of this industry in South Africa are endless,” says Van der Westhuizen. Not only does Zorora provide local furniture solutions that don’t cost the earth, but it is also supporting local suppliers and communities, creating jobs and bringing furniture production back to the country. This results in a decrease in toxic emissions and reducing carbon footprints, ultimately offering a sustainable solution.
