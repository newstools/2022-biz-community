The report recommends that vendors focus on building analytics platforms for the most value to be driven from deployments.Non-residential smart buildings driving spendThe research found that non-residential smart buildings will account for 90% of smart building spend globally in 2026, at a similar level to 2022. This dominance is due to the larger economies of scale in commercial premises driving this spend, as well as the commercial focus of most smart building technologies.Research co-author Dawnetta Grant explains: “Smart building platform vendors will understandably focus on non-residential use cases as these provide a stronger return on investment, but they should not neglect the importance of residential deployments as environmental concerns intensify.”Buildings of the future - here are the 5 essential pillarsBy Okkie Momberg 3 days agoSmart building sensor shipments to accelerate quicklyThe research found that the global shipments of sensors used in smart buildings will exceed 1 billion annually in 2026 from 360 million in 2022, representing a growth of 204%. Sensors, when combined with intelligent management platforms, will allow smart buildings to adapt to conditions, matching elements such as lighting, heating and ventilation to live requirements. The report recommends that smart building vendors partner with AI vendors to maximise the benefits of automation, such as reduced energy costs and improved working environments.Download the free whitepaper here.
