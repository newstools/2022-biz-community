In this new partnership, Eduvos will be awarding a Titans Cricket player a bursary to the value of R38,000. Eduvos realises that learning is a lifelong journey and has several higher certificates and short learning programmes for adult learners who want to upskill and further themselves in their careers.  “We are so pleased to be working with Titans Cricket, and to be able to award a bursary to one lucky player. We hope this is just the beginning of more exciting things to come,” said Elna Lombard, Eduvos Pretoria Campus general manager. Titans Cricket have selected player Josephine Maswangane as the winner of the bursary. Josephine will be studying a short learning programme in Basic Programming with Eduvos. “I am so excited that Titans Cricket and Eduvos have given me this opportunity to further my studies! I’m really looking forward to learning more about information technology and programming, and I hope I can make my team proud,” said Josephine, bursary winner. Good luck Josephine! We wish you the very best with your studies. Learn more about Eduvos at eduvos.com and Titans Cricket at titans.co.za.
