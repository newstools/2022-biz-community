Ralf Fletcher, CEO of Topco MediaWhile the numbers on women in business may appear to be encouraging, it is evident that there is still a long way to go. There are many barriers that prevent women from completely empowering themselves, some of which arise from concerns that have traditionally taken root in the minds of many. Recognising them aids in their eradication.“Empowerment is an ongoing process,” says Ralf Fletcher, CEO of Topco Media, organiser of the annual Standard Bank Top Women Awards. “This entails questioning long-held cultural conventions that are detrimental to women. Empowerment campaigns also push for changes in laws and practices that are discriminatory or unjust to women.”Are you ready to highlight your gender empowerment?The prestigious Standard Bank Top Women Awards, taking place on 10 November 2022, recognise and honour outstanding leadership, inspiration, vision, and innovation in organisations that help women rise to the top of the economic ladder. “If you are a businesswoman, it is time to take more firm steps toward your empowerment,” says Fletcher. “And if you have women on your team, it is your responsibility to foster a culture that supports their participation in your company or organisation. Empowering yourself and/or others helps to expand your business, the economy, and the establishment of more diverse and inclusive workplaces.” Featuring corporate and individual awards, these annual awards recognise and honour outstanding leadership, inspiration, vision, and innovation in organisations that help women rise to the top of the economic ladder. Covering all key economic areas and recognising businesses at all levels, from SMME to national.“Today's empowered woman is tomorrow's leader for change,” emphasises Fletcher.Reasons to enterAs a business leader, you know recognition is important.
