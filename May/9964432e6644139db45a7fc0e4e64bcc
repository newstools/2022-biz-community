The main objective of our challenge is to protect the future sustainability of the local news industry. The proposed draft legislation aims to ensure fair and equitable remuneration for South African news media businesses, large and small, for the use of their content.“Although the initiative is led by the founder members of the PSS (Arena Holdings, Caxton, Independent Media, Mail & Guardian and Media24), I strongly appeal to other news organisations to join the campaign by making submissions to the Commission. Protecting journalism as a cornerstone of our democracy is a shared responsibility of the industry at large.”Success in other parts of the worldKarjieker reiterated the success achieved by similar efforts in other parts of the world, most notably Australia and Europe, that forced these platforms to the negotiating table to have them agree on fair compensation to publishers for their content. “The PSS is available to assist local news publishers and businesses in making their submissions or answering queries," says Karjieker . Submissions can also be made directly to the Competition Commission at oipmi@compcom.co.za, marked for the attention of James Hodge, to reach the Commission by the end of May 2022.
