The latest TVC, created by Grey/WPP Liquid for Hunter's, portrays how the contemporary young South African man doesn't let the rules hold him back because sometimes the rules need refreshment. He defies the rules of a film set and takes control, changing his environment and thus the script to showcase and bring his personality and objectives to life. Sometimes challenging the current situation is liberating and leads to refreshing the rules. Living in a digital era has evolved the recipe for success. It empowers young adults to create opportunities that were non-existing previously – Hunter's Premium Cider consistently refreshes culture and calls for young adults to take a chance at making anything they dream about, a reality. “To launch the new proposition, 'Refresh the Rules', we needed to think of an ad that conveyed this sentiment simply and in the most entertaining way. After a few rounds of thoughts and ideas, we landed on something that, in hindsight, feels almost effortless: A script … or the idea of flipping it, literally, instead. 'Flipping the script' is a term that has become synonymous with doing unexpected things or challenging the status quo. That is precisely what our protagonist does when he is confronted by a prescriptive world holding him back from being himself”, says Marcus Moshapalo, Creative Director of Grey Advertising Africa. Today's young adults have a particular know-how, which allows them to see things differently from societal norms. Hunter’s is set to celebrate originality in all its shapes and sizes.View the new TVC here: Credits:Grey / WPP LiquidECD: Felix KesselCD: Marcus MoshapaloCreative team: Andre De Jager and Ayesha KapreyProducer: Lara BayleyAccount Management: Jacqui Howard-Tripp, Roshan Williams Khan and Jane Carlisle Production house: PlankDirector: Peter Pohorsky Producer: Seamus BaxEditor: Xander van der WesthuizenPost facility: Strangelove StudiosAudio: Sterling Sound, Lorens Persson Music: Nathi – A Nathi Sound​Refresh the Rules with Hunter’s.#RefreshTheRules #HuntersRefreshes #StaySafeHunter’s Cider promotes responsible drinking.
