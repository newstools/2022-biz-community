This is because there is still a shortage of diesel supply which is due to lower exports from Russia as a major exporter of distillate fuel, low inventories globally as well as higher demand for distillates," he said.The Minister also announced that the implementation of revised zones differentials into the price of fuel will become effective as of Wednesday."The annual adjustments to road transport tariffs applicable in petrol, diesel and [illuminating paraffin] price structures will range from a decrease of 33.4 c/l in Gordonia South Magisterial District Pricing Zone to an increase of 3.0 c/l (Zone 9C-Gauteng)."The primary transport tariffs applicable to the transport of petrol and diesel mainly by means of the pipeline network will increase. Because of the different transport tariff adjustments to be effective on [Wednesday], price changes to similar products will differ in the 54 Magisterial District Pricing Zones," he said.
