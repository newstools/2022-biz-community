To protect and expand upon these vital gains in the wake of Covid, teachers, NGOs, politicians, tech entrepreneurs, and figures from the public and private sectors, will need to work together to build a future where every child in Africa can achieve the quality education that is their birthright. "Africa’s great changemakers recognise that education is the key to our future," said Mlambo-Ngcuka. "From the classrooms to the corridors of power, from the libraries to the laboratories, they are working every day to ensure we deliver a brighter tomorrow for our continent’s children. I call on these inspirational leaders from South Africa and across Africa to step forward and apply for the Africa Education Medal so their stories can inspire thousands more."Education must be a crisis priority, not an afterthoughtBy Dr Edward K.
