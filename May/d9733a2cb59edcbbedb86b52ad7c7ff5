This entails providing information on how to enrol at varsity, providing career guidance and financial assistance.New NPO brings together world-leading companies to help achieve UN SDGs28 Apr 2022About her own experience, Mahlangu said: "I almost gave up at the beginning of my studies when I was still a domestic worker. It’s because of the assistance of my former employer who paid for my exams that I had hope and the willpower to carry on. I believe there is someone who may have lost hope due to lack of finance or information. All they need is a helping hand."Help One Helper will officially be launched in August this year.
