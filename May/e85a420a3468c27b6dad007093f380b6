Since the  EU-South Africa Economic Partnership Agreement (SADC-EPA)  was signed in June 2016, South Africans have continued to gain greater access to a diverse range of European food and beverage products. It is for this reason that the European Union has undertaken promotional efforts to help more businesses leverage the quality, safety, authenticity and sustainability of European products in order to win loyal customers in South Africa.Agri-food relations, sustainability and safetyH.E. Riina Kionka, ambassador of the European Union to South Africa, John Clarke, European Commission’s agriculture department’s international affairs director, along with further European and South African representatives will host presentations and discuss agri-food relations, sustainability and EU food quality and safety system. They will also share insights into the EU single market’s operations when it comes to food production, food safety, animal and plant health and animal welfare.Roundtable discussions and breakout sessions will explore what these strict standards mean in terms of product benefits, as well as understand how their business can benefit from the SADC-EPA, which saw the removal of customs duties on 86% of imports from the EU among other provisions facilitating trade and sustainable development.The first day will debate how to boost EU-South Africa agri-food trade, followed by presentations and breakout sessions on the EU’s food safety and quality systems, including its Farm to Fork strategy to accelerate sustainability. Popular chef and TV presenter Katlego Mlambo will then show off his culinary skills with a live cooking show to bring quality EU ingredients to life.With the EPA also including the protection of 249 European Geographical Indications (GIs) covering foodstuffs, beer, spirits and wine, the second day will take a deep dive into the reciprocal trade benefits and opportunities of the GI system, using EU cheese as a case study.
