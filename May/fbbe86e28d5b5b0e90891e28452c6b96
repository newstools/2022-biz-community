In the midst of all this, it has been incredibly disheartening to know that several schools and communities continue to struggle with sustainable access to clean water. The Woolies Water Fund is our effort to support schools with this challenge,” said Pieter Twine, general manager at MySchool.Woolies raises R2.5m to boost South Africa's food security23 Feb 2022Sustainable water-saving initiativesAccording to Twine, the fund has supplied and installed 132 water tanks in 77 schools across four provinces as well as more than 540 handwashing stations. Local water pipes, gutters, and filtration systems have also been upgraded to ensure that schools and their surrounding communities have sustainable access to clean and fresh water.“We are committed to conserving water through implementing sustainable water-saving initiatives as well as by setting up secure infrastructure at schools that desperately need a sustainable water supply in order to function properly,” added Twine.Source: SuppliedFunding for water infrastructureCustomers can help to raise more funding for water infrastructure in schools by choosing the Woolies Water Fund as their MySchool MyVillage MyPlanet beneficiary.“Many schools across the country simply do not have reliable access to water, for health and sanitation purposes. Our children need water for their well-being, and we would not be able to have such a positive impact on the provision of water to schools and poor communities if it was not for the commitment of our customers who help us contribute to the fund every time they swipe their MySchool cards in store,” concluded Twine.To join, go to www.myschool.co.za and nominate the Woolies Water Fund as your beneficiary or SMS ‘water’ to 31231.
