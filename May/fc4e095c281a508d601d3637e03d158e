Since the campaign launch, more than 100 submissions have been received. From these, the final six designs have been shortlisted by our judges. Now, it’s up to you to choose which should be brought to life as the symbolic 12th chair for South Africa’s highest court. “We encourage everyone to vote for the chair that they feel upholds the values and principles of our Constitution,” says Constitution Hill Trust CEO Vanessa September. “The chosen chair will find a permanent place on Constitution Hill.” “The Constitution was written by and for South Africans, so it makes sense that the people deserve a seat at the highest court in the land,” says executive creative director at Ogilvy, Peter Little. “The 12th chair will represent that. It’s the people’s seat of power. And now, the people can vote for the design that speaks to this power.” Now is the time to cast your vote for the people’s chair. The design with the most votes wins. Voting closes on 31 May 2022. To vote, visit https://wethepeople.constitutionhill.org.za/12th-chair. The power of kings, queens, judges, parliamentary speakers, archbishops and presidents is reflected in the chairs they occupy. We, the people, also have the right to exercise our voices and fill a seat of power.
